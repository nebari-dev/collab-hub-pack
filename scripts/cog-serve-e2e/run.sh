# End-to-end for publishing and pulling Cogs through the Hub (issues #179, #180), against a real registry.
#
# Starts a private OCI registry (the "backing" registry, behind a credential
# only the Hub holds), starts the Hub with that registry as its publish
# source -- a `static` source with no repository list -- and then publishes
# a Cog bundle *to the Hub host* and pulls it back *from the Hub host* with
# `oras`, holding nothing but a Hub sign-in. The same script runs against two
# different registries:
#
#   scripts/cog-serve-e2e/run.sh distribution   # distribution/registry
#   scripts/cog-serve-e2e/run.sh zot            # project-zot/zot
#
# Nothing between the two runs changes on the client side, which is the
# point: the registry behind the Hub is the operator's choice.
#
# The layout, so the clients see what they would in a deployment:
#
#   client container (oras) --https--> hub.test (a TLS proxy) --> the Hub
#                                                                        |
#                    backing.test (the registry) <--- its own credential-+
#
# The Hub runs as a process on this machine (`uv run`), everything else is a
# container on one docker network. Clients reach the Hub at https://hub.test
# with a throwaway CA, as they would in a deployment.
#
# Needs docker, uv, curl and jq.
