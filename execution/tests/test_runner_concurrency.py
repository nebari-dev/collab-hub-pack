"""Calls that move one run from two threads of one host: claims, cancel, and the run's end.

Every call that moves a run claims it before it reads or writes, and a cancel is
taken only while the driver advances the run, under the same condition the
driver holds to write a step's result or the run's end. Each test holds one
thread just before a Track write, and moves the run from another one there.
