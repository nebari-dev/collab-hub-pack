"""The durability conformance suite: what survives a host that stops.

A durable backend (``dbos``, Phase 25; ``temporal``, Phase 31) resumes a run
killed mid-step without resubmission, resumes one paused at a Gate there, and
never lets two replicas run one step; those cases join this suite with the
backends. ``none`` is not durable, and this suite holds it to that contract
instead: a run its stopped host left unfinished is recorded ``interrupted`` when a
host starts, never resumed, and continues only when someone retries it.
