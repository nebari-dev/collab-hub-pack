"""The engine contract, and the names callers have imported from here.

The lifecycle lives in ``LifecycleRunner`` (``runner.py``), which implements the
``WorkflowEngine`` contract and runs on the durability backend its configuration
names (``backends/``). The Op, its steps and the seam's types are in ``ops.py``.
``DurableWorkflowEngine``, the reference engine that recovered runs from the
Track, is gone with that recovery (ADR-0002 D2): a run a stopped host left
unfinished is ``interrupted``, and continues only through ``retry()``. Everything
this module used to define is re-exported here for callers that import it from it.
