"""Durability backends: how the runner's step functions are scheduled, and whether progress is checkpointed.

ADR-0002 D1. The lifecycle runner has one driver, and every backend shares it:
the driver hands each step function to the backend through
:meth:`DurabilityBackend.run_step`, and the backend decides only how that call is
scheduled and whether what it returned is checkpointed. A backend holds no
lifecycle logic: it never decides what runs next.

A backend is chosen by configuration, ``none``, ``dbos`` or ``temporal``, through
:func:`select_backend`, and callers never import one. ``none`` is implemented;
``dbos`` and ``temporal`` are refused when a runner starts until Phases 26 and 32
of the plan build them, so the configuration shape is fixed now.
