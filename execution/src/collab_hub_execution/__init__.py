"""Execution contracts shared by the Hub's Cog and Op implementations.

Experimental: Python interfaces, the worker protocol, and event schemas are
subject to breaking changes. See execution/README.md for current limitations.

Guarantees and non-goals
------------------------
``LifecycleRunner`` runs Ops on the durability backend its configuration names.
Only ``none`` is built, and it is single-owner, at-least-once, and not durable:

- **Not durable.** Nothing survives the host. When a host starts, ``start()``
  records every run a stopped host left running or waiting at a Gate as
  ``interrupted``; none of them resumes. ``retry()`` continues an interrupted
  run's attempt under its idempotency key, and runs a failed step as a new
  attempt with a new key. Submitting a run again never resumes it.
- **Single-owner.** It holds no cross-replica lease, so one run must be advanced
  by one owner at a time. The Postgres Track's one-submission-per-run index guards
  a duplicate *submission*, not two callers concurrently *advancing* the same run.
- **At-least-once.** The reference and Kubernetes workers do not persist keys, so
  a retried attempt re-runs its side effect until the keyed claim (#102) answers
  for it. Terminal runs are immutable apart from ``retry()``; runs that exhausted a
  duration/token/cost budget require a new run id.

Do not use it for multi-replica production execution until the ``dbos`` backend
(#104), run pickup (#121) and the keyed claim (#102) land. ``WorkflowEngine`` and
the Track, executor and backend interfaces separate these concerns, but their
shapes are still experimental.
