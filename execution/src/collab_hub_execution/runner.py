"""The lifecycle runner: a Cog's lifecycle, written once, as step functions and the driver that runs them.

ADR-0002 D1 puts the lifecycle in one component that every durability backend
schedules. This is that component, in two parts.

The *step functions*, registered in ``STEP_FUNCTIONS``, are the units of work.
An attempt resolves its identity, materializes its worker, interacts and reads
the envelope, then tears the worker down whatever happened, since the worker is
one-shot. Only then does the step end: failed if it produced no result,
otherwise through its Gate, which completes it or escalates it. Each function
moves the state machines of ``states`` by asking them for a transition and
writing the records it returns; none assigns a state itself.

The *driver*, ``_advance`` with ``_run_attempt``, sequences them, and is
lifecycle logic too: it picks the run up and completes it, skips the steps
already completed, completes an approved escalation instead of running the step
again, checks and consumes the budget at step boundaries, and maps a failure to
the attempt's outcome and its unknown usage.

There is one driver and it is shared: every durability backend (``backends/``)
is handed each step function through ``DurabilityBackend.run_step`` and decides
only how it is scheduled and whether what it returned is checkpointed, never
what runs next. ``none``, the only backend built, calls them in process and
keeps nothing, so ``start()`` records a run a stopped host left unfinished as
``interrupted`` rather than resuming it (ADR-0002 D2).
