"""Agent locations: where a Cog worker runs, relative to the controller.

ADR-0002 D12. The lifecycle runner drives every worker through the same seam
(``POST /invoke``, ``GET /healthz``) and the same executor interface
(``materialize``, ``teardown``); the location decides only where the worker is
brought up. An executor holds no lifecycle logic: it never decides what runs
next, and it writes nothing to the Track.

A location is chosen by configuration, ``local`` or ``remote``, through
:func:`select_executor`, and callers never import an executor. ``local`` is
implemented: the worker is a process on the controller's host. ``remote``, the
worker as a workload on a cluster, is refused when a runner starts until Phase
20 of the plan puts it behind this switch, so the configuration shape is fixed
now.
