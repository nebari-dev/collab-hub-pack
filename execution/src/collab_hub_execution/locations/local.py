"""The ``local`` agent location: a Cog worker as a process on the controller's host.

``LocalProcessCogExecutor`` materializes a worker by running the Cog package's
declared ``serve`` task, in the package's own pixi environment, bound to a
loopback port the executor chooses. The worker is started through the launcher
(``launcher.py``), which kills the worker's process group when the controller
lets go of it or dies. The executor holds no lifecycle logic: it brings a
worker up, says where it is, and tears it down.

What a worker gets from the controller is its environment and nothing else: a
short allowlist of the controller's variables that a process needs to run at
all, the seam's variables (where to listen, its Cog, its run, its run token),
and what the binding delivers. Its output goes to a directory per run, never to
the Track.
