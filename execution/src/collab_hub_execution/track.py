"""Durable, replayable Track events and status derivation.

A Track is the append-only record of one Op. Callers observe a run by reading
the Track; status is a projection of its events, never a separately maintained
mutable field: the run machine (``states/run.py``) folded over the events.

Every event carries ``schema``, the version of its shape. Version 1 is the
schema ``docs/cog-execution/track.md`` describes, and the engine writes it; an
event with ``schema`` 0 was written before it (or built without saying), and
:func:`upgrade` reads it in the version-1 shape.

    The pool is supplied by the application, so this adapter does not create

    gives each event a stable replay order, including events written by
    multiple API replicas.

    A sequence is drawn when a row is inserted, but rows become visible when
    they commit, and two transactions can commit in the other order. A reader
    that had seen the later sequence would move its cursor past the earlier one
    and never return it. So appends to one run are serialized: each takes a
    transaction-scoped advisory lock on the run before its insert draws a
    sequence, and holds it until it commits. Within a run, sequence order is
    then commit order, and a cursor over one run's events never skips one.
    Appends to different runs do not wait for each other.

    On the hub the tables come from the ``collab_`` migration registry
    (``COLLAB_SCHEMA_MIGRATIONS`` in the API), never from :meth:`ensure_schema`,
    which exists for the standalone package and local use. ``_SCHEMA`` is the
