"""The run controller: the process that advances runs, separate from the one that accepts them.

    collab-hub-run-controller --track FILE_OR_URL --packages DIR [--packages DIR ...] --work-dir DIR

ADR-0002 D4. The API writes intent to the Track (``intents.py``) — a
submission, a request to cancel, a turn, a decision on a Gate — and the
controller watches the Track and acts on it. Nothing calls the controller, and
it alone constructs an executor.

**Pickup.** A run submitted and not yet picked up is started on the lifecycle
runner, which records ``run_picked_up`` naming this controller only if, as the
record lands, nobody has picked the run up or cancelled it. Several controllers
share one Track, a SQLite file on one host or Postgres anywhere, and of those
picking up one run, one starts it.

**Ownership.** Under ``none`` a picked-up run belongs to the controller that
picked it up: it alone advances it, delivers its cancel, its turns and the
decision on its Gate, and when it stops, the run ends ``interrupted`` with it.
A controller is known by its id (``--id``, this host's name by default), which
it holds for as long as it runs — a lock beside a SQLite Track, an advisory lock
on Postgres — so two live controllers never share one. When it starts, it
records ``interrupted`` for every run it picked up and did not finish, and
reaps any of their ``local`` workers left alive. Under ``dbos`` and
``temporal`` the engine takes ownership after pickup (Phases 26 and 32).

**Models.** ``--models FILE`` is the hub's ``models:`` block: the models it
offers and which Cog talks to which; each worker receives its Cog's model, and
no other (``binding.ModelsBlock``).

**Health.** With ``--health-port``, ``GET /healthz`` answers 200 while the
controller is passing over the Track, and ``GET /readyz`` once it has started
and its last pass read the Track.
