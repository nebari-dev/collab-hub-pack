        A Cog cannot pause a run: its problems go to the step's Gate, which
        decides whether a person looks at the result.

        ``idempotency_key`` is stable per (run, step, attempt): a crash-recovery
        re-drives the same incomplete step with the *same* key, and an explicit
        retry or a send back at a Gate uses a *new* key. ``input`` always contains
        the step's original input; ``signal`` carries a send back's findings
        separately and is omitted until a step is sent back.
        A worker that persists results by key can turn the
        replay into a no-op — but that durability is the worker's to provide. The
        reference and Kubernetes workers here do NOT persist keys across pod
        replacement, so a replaced worker re-runs the side effect: execution is
        at-least-once across pod replacement. Crash-safe, exactly-once execution
        (a durable keyed claim) lands with the crash-safe engine backing tracked
