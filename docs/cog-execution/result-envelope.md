# The result envelope (version 1)

What a Cog's usage entry point returns. This is the hub's profile answer to
two things the Cog specification deliberately leaves to hosting
environments — the payload key and the pass/fail surface — and it belongs
in the hub's capability list, not in the Cog spec. A Cog that emits this
envelope is compatible with the hub's seam; other environments may require
otherwise.

The envelope is requirements-driven: its fields are exactly what Guards
check, Gates read, and Tracks record. Nothing else.

```json

## Field rules

**`envelope`** — the version discriminator for this contract (`1` today).
Consumers detect the envelope version here, not by sniffing field shapes.

**`cog`** / **`task`** — which Cog and which usage entry point produced this
result.

**`payload`** — the fixed key for the Cog's output. Its shape is the Cog's
own declared output schema; `null` when the run errored or the output did
not parse.

**`ok`** — transport-level success: the invocation completed and produced
a parseable payload. **`ok: true` may coexist with a non-empty `problems`
list.** "Passed with integrity problems" is deliberately legible, and
deciding what to do about it is a Gate's job (human or reviewer Cog) —
never the Cog's.

**`error`** — `null`, or `{code, detail}`. Codes: `binding-invalid`,
`invalid-input`, `model-unavailable`, `model-call-failed`,
`model-response-malformed`. When set, `ok` is `false`. Over HTTP, the
status maps 4xx/5xx accordingly: 422 for `invalid-input`, 502 for an
upstream fault, 503 for unavailable/binding.

**`problems`** — the Cog's self-reported **contract-check** findings,
structured for Guards and Gates to consume: `check` (machine-readable
category — `schema`, `grounding`, `citation`, `identity`, `input`, …),
`detail` (a human sentence), `severity` (`error` | `warn`). These come from
the Cog checking its *own* declared contract. An independent Guard verifies
against the *system's* requirements and never treats this self-report as
its verdict.

**`binding`** — the Track fields: the complete binding identity copied into
every result, so a saved result identifies its run (which pinned model,
which endpoint, identity verdict, violations) without reading current
installation state. This is what makes a Gate signature auditable.

**`raw`** — the verbatim model text, for audit and salvage review.

**`usage`** — tokens and cost attributable to this interaction, at the
envelope level (not inside `payload`, which is the Cog's own output).
Optional; absent when the Cog cannot report it.

**`timing`** — wall-clock latency of the interaction.

## What the hub does with it

- The **Track** records the envelope's `binding`, `problems`, `usage`, and
  a reference to `payload` for each step.
- **Guards** run on `payload` and read `problems` as input.
- The **Gate** declared on the Op step consumes `ok`, `problems`, and Guard
  findings and decides ok / ok-with-problems / escalate. A pause for human
  review is the Gate's outcome, not something the Cog requests.
- **Budgets** consume `usage`.

## Versioning

This document is `envelope: 1`. Additive changes (new optional fields) do
not bump the version; changing the meaning or type of an existing field
does. Consumers must ignore unknown fields.
