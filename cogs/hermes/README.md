# The Hermes harness Cog

[Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com) as a Cog: the hub launches it, keeps a session open with it, and relays turns to it, without knowing it is Hermes. [`examples/cog-local`](../../examples/cog-local/README.md) walks through it end to end.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `serve.py` | The worker the run controller starts. Standard library only |
| `hermes_acp.py` | How the worker starts Hermes: `hermes acp`, with no tools |
| `pixi.toml` | The package: Python 3.12 and `hermes-agent[acp,anthropic]`, and the `serve` task |
| `pixi.lock` | That environment, pinned for Linux and macOS |

## What the worker does

It serves the seam every Cog worker serves (`GET /healthz`, `POST /invoke`, and `POST /turn` while a session is open, [`op-cog-seam.md`](../../docs/cog-execution/op-cog-seam.md)), and is an [ACP](https://agentclientprotocol.com) client of Hermes: it starts `hermes acp` as a child process and speaks JSON-RPC to it, one message per line.

| Entry point | Input | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `session` | none | Opens a Hermes session and holds it. Each turn the hub delivers is one prompt, answered with what Hermes said. It ends on `bye`, or when the run is terminated and the worker with it |
| `ask` | `{"prompt": "..."}` | Answers one prompt and returns `{"answer": "..."}` |

A turn that arrives while Hermes is still starting waits for the session, up to five minutes. If Hermes exits during a session, the session ends at once and the step fails `model-call-failed`, saying so, rather than holding the run open.

## Its model

The controller delivers the model in the worker's environment, to this Cog and no other:

| Variable | What |
|---|---|
| `COLLAB_MODEL_PROVIDER` | `openai-compatible` (the default), or `anthropic` for Claude through Hermes's own Anthropic provider, which uses the Anthropic SDK |
| `COLLAB_MODEL_BASE_URL` | The OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Not used with `anthropic` |
| `COLLAB_MODEL_NAME` | The model's id. With `anthropic`, `claude-opus-5-5` when unset |
| `COLLAB_MODEL_API_KEY` | Its key. Required with `anthropic` |

A model the worker cannot use fails the step `model-unavailable`, saying why. `make -C dev controller` delivers them, with [`dev/fake-model`](../../dev/fake-model/fake_model.py) as the default: an endpoint that answers `The fake model heard: ...` with no account and no network. [`examples/cog-local`](../../examples/cog-local/README.md) switches to Claude when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set. Model bindings resolved by the hub replace this in a later phase of the plan.

## What Hermes sees

- **A home of its own.** Each session gets a temporary workspace, which is also Hermes's `HOME`, and `HERMES_HOME` inside it holds only a `config.yaml` naming the delivered model. Nothing of the machine's own `~/.hermes` is read or changed, and Hermes finds no credentials of its own: its Anthropic provider would otherwise prefer Claude Code's sign-in to any key. The workspace is removed when the session ends or the worker is stopped.
- **Only its model's key.** Hermes's environment is an allowlist (`PATH`, `LANG` and the like), so the run token, and any provider key the worker's environment happens to hold, never reach it: Hermes picks up whatever key it finds. Its model's key reaches it in its config file, readable by its owner alone, or, for Claude, as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, the only way Hermes 0.19's Anthropic provider takes one.
- **The API its provider names, and nothing installed.** With `openai-compatible`, Hermes speaks chat completions whatever the URL's host: Hermes 0.19 would otherwise pick an API from the host, Bedrock's Converse through boto3 for `bedrock-runtime.*.amazonaws.com`. Its lazy installs are off, so it never installs a provider's SDK into the locked environment, from the network, mid-session; a feature that needs one is unavailable instead.
- **No tools.** The first Hermes run is prompt in, answer out (decision 14 of the plan): no command, no file, no browser, no web. Hermes 0.19's ACP adapter enables its whole toolset for every session and reads no setting that narrows it, so the worker starts Hermes through [`hermes_acp.py`](hermes_acp.py), which gives each session no toolsets at all. Its model is then offered no tools, and a tool call it makes anyway fails with `Tool '...' does not exist`; a test checks it with a model that orders a shell command. Should Hermes ask its client's permission for anything, the worker refuses.

## Running it

From the hub, which is the point: `collab-hub cog launch hermes --entry session`, then `collab-hub run say RUN ...` or `toad acp "collab-hub run connect RUN"`.

Its tests run the real worker against a stand-in ACP agent, and Hermes itself against the fake model when this environment is installed: `execution/tests/test_hermes_cog.py`.
