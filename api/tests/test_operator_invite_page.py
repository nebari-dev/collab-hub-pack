"""The operator invitation page (issue #91), including its amendment.

What these prove, and what they deliberately do not.

**Proven here.** A signed-in non-operator reaches neither the page nor the
action, and the action refuses independently of the route it was reached
through. Every invitation the page issues carries a null ``org_id``, so no
organization row exists until acceptance — checked against a live database by
issuing, revoking, and finding nothing left behind. Issuing twice for one
address mints no second live token, including when the two issuances are
genuinely concurrent. Issuing hands the secret to the invitation mail adapter
and the page reports the sanitized outcome. And the token: it reaches the
handler through an **in-process** call — proven by issuing on an app whose
``/v1`` invitation routes have been removed — appears in **no** HTTP response
at all, and is in no log record at any level.

**Previously proven here, and deliberately inverted:** between the 2026-08-07
amendment to #91 and the completion of an internal issue,
this page rendered the live secret for an operator to send by hand and
suppressed the SES send. ``web/invite_link.py`` held that decision and its end
condition; the condition is met, the module is deleted, and the tests that
pinned the rendered link are gone with it. One secret, one route.
