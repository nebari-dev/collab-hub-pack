"""The server-rendered pages' stylesheet, and what it reaches for.

The pages under ``/web`` share one stylesheet, served as its own route. It
names the same typeface the React bundles are built with, and those font files
come from the registration bundle, which is public. These tests pin the part
that fails silently: a stylesheet whose font files do not resolve renders in
the fallback face and nothing reports it.
