"""The onboarding email template (#155).

The copy lives in exactly one place — ``web/onboarding_email.txt`` — so there
is no second copy to drift from. What these tests protect instead is the
template's contract with the renderer: every placeholder the copy uses is one
something substitutes, the two that cannot be derived from an invitation are the
only ones that can survive a partial render, and the file stays wrapped for
plain-text email.

The failure these are written against is a future copy edit — someone adds
``[ORGANIZATION]`` to the template, nothing fills it in, and an invitee reads
it verbatim.
