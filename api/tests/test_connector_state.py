"""Turning a connector off, and having that actually mean something.

The switch lives in the database; the credentials stay in deployment
configuration. That split is the whole design: configuration decides what this
hub is *capable* of, and the switch decides what is *available* right now. A
disabled connector therefore looks exactly like an unconfigured one to every
route that uses it, which is a refusal those routes already handle.
