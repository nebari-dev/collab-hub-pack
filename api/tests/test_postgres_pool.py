"""Behavior of the shared psycopg connection pools (issue #58).

Covers the acceptance criteria beyond what test_postgres_auto_migration
asserts (stores never open direct per-request connections):

- one pool is shared per database URL;
- Postgres down and pool exhaustion both surface as ``PoolTimeout`` after the
  configured bounded wait — never an indefinite hang — and the app maps that
  to an explicit 503 ``database_unavailable`` response;
- a *healthy but saturated* pool queues waiters, bounds that queue
  (``max_waiting`` → ``TooManyRequests``), and keeps best-effort usage capture
  off the critical path so authenticated HTTP and MCP traffic stay responsive;
- a *healthy but stalled* server — one that answers the checkout and then never
  answers the statement — likewise delays neither authenticated, MCP, nor
  unrelated traffic, because best-effort writes do not run on request threads
  at all;
- the cancel that bounds such a stalled statement stays aimed at it: a
  connection never goes back to the pool with a cancel still in flight, so the
  next borrower's query cannot be killed by the previous borrower's watchdog;
- ``/health/db`` reports pool status without leaking connection URLs.

The saturation and stall tests run against ``stub_postgres_server``, a real
listener that completes the psycopg handshake, so the pool genuinely hands out,
queues, and blocks on connections. Real-Postgres integration coverage (schema,
migrations, query behavior) is deferred to a separate harness — there is no
Postgres service in CI today.
