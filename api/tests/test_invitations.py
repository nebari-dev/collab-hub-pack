"""The invitation service (issue #89): create, list, revoke, body-based accept.

Coverage maps onto the R3/R11 acceptance list, and the live-Postgres tests are
where the load-bearing claims are actually proven rather than inspected:

1. **Concurrent acceptance of one token yields one membership and one org.**
   Proven twice over — once with a deterministic, forced interleaving (a held
   ``FOR UPDATE`` lock, and a held conflicting membership insert, so the exact
   contended code path runs on demand rather than when the scheduler feels
   like it), and once with real threads racing through the whole service.
2. **Every terminal state is explicit**: expired, revoked, replayed,
   unverified, mismatched, already-in-an-organization — each with its own
   registered wire code, and none of them consuming the token.
3. **Exact-match email** (Gate B, 2026-08-03), including what happens when
   the verified claim changes between issuance and acceptance, in both
   directions.
4. **The two authority axes** produce identical ``invitation.send`` rows
   differing only in the actor, and an owner cannot name another
   organization.
5. **Atomicity**: a failed issuance leaves neither invitation nor event row,
   and a failed acceptance leaves neither organization nor membership nor
   event row — and the token still pending.
6. **The raw token never appears** in a response body, a log record, or an
   audit row, and a near-miss token is not echoed back by a 422.

Live-Postgres tests opt in with ``COLLAB_HUB_TEST_POSTGRES_URL``, exactly as
``test_operator_foundation.py``; everything else runs everywhere.

    PostgreSQL's ``now()`` is fixed at transaction start, and ``audited()``
    opens the transaction *before* the locked read. So an acceptance that
    blocks on ``FOR UPDATE`` — or later on a conflicting membership insert —
    keeps evaluating expiry against the instant its request began. Every
    check happened while the invitation was still live; by the time the
    consume ran, it was not. The window is exactly as long as contention
    lasts, and this suite's own concurrency tests hold that lock deliberately.

    Reproduced here at its widest: a short-lived invitation, the row pinned
    under another transaction's lock until it lapses, and only then released.
    The acceptance must resolve to *expired* — and must leave nothing behind,
    because an expiry discovered at the consume is still a rollback.
