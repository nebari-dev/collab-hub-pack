"""Publishing through the Hub (issue #180): what stays true when a push goes wrong, or two happen at once.

The happy paths and the authorization matrix are ``test_cog_publishing``.
These are the edges between the Hub's records and the backing registry's:
what a token may push to, repository by repository; what a refused or lost
manifest leaves behind; where a moved tag ends up; what a client is told
when the registry has a manifest the catalog could not list; upload sessions
at the cap, past their expiry and under two requests at once; a sweep racing
a publish; and what the Hub's HTTP client logs about the registry it writes
to.
