"""What the panel can truthfully say about a connector.

The interesting constraint is that most connectors here are *brokered*: the
credential is minted per user, so the hub holds no token of its own and cannot
answer "does this connector work" on anyone's behalf. Reporting a green tick
from a configuration value would be a claim the server cannot support.
