"""Startup-path coverage for the Postgres stores' auto-migration.

The API test suite runs everything else on the in-memory backends, so nothing
here exercised ``auto_migrate=True`` construction — the configuration real
deployments use. A refactor once swallowed
``PostgresActiveFrameStore._ensure_schema`` into an adjacent method, and pods
with auto-migration enabled would have crashed at startup with
``AttributeError``. These tests construct every Postgres store against a
stubbed pooled database and assert the migration DDL actually runs — and that
no store ever opens a direct ``psycopg.connect`` (issue #58: everything goes
through the shared connection pool).

The stub keeps this a fast startup-path test that needs no database. Verifying
the DDL against a real server (that the statements are valid Postgres and are
idempotent across restarts) needs a real-Postgres harness, which CI does not
have yet; that is tracked separately. Pool behavior under saturation is covered
against a real pool in ``test_postgres_pool.py``.

The second half of this module (issue #42) covers the fix for the race that
sits behind that untested startup path: bare ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` is
not concurrency-safe in Postgres, so two replicas starting at once could both
pass the existence check and race the catalog insert, crashing one pod with a
duplicate-key error on ``pg_type``/``pg_class``. Every store's ``_ensure_schema``
now opens its DDL transaction through
``collab_hub_api.frames.db.locked_schema_connection``, which takes
``pg_advisory_xact_lock`` before touching the catalog at all. ``LockEnforcingServer``
below is the same enforcement device as ``FakeServer`` in
``test_collab_schema.py`` — a real ``threading.Lock`` that refuses any
statement issued by a thread that does not currently hold it — applied here to
the five pre-existing ``frames_server_``/``nexus_task_`` stores instead of the
``collab_`` migration runner.

A third, opt-in layer (``COLLAB_HUB_TEST_POSTGRES_URL``, same convention as
``test_collab_schema.py``) races real replicas of every store against a real
server, which is the only way to observe the actual failure mode the issue
describes rather than a modeled stand-in for it.

# ``FakeDatabase``/``FakeConnection`` above only record what ran; they cannot
# tell an ordering bug (lock taken after the first CREATE, or not taken at
# all) from a correct migration, because nothing stops an unguarded statement
# from being recorded. ``LockEnforcingServer`` closes that gap the same way
# ``test_collab_schema.py``'s ``FakeServer`` does: it is backed by a real
# ``threading.Lock``, and it raises if any statement — including the schema's
# own version-agnostic ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` — reaches it from a
# thread that is not the current lock holder. A store whose ``_ensure_schema``
# regressed to a bare ``db.connection()`` would fail these tests immediately;
# one that raced under genuine concurrency would fail
# ``test_concurrent_ensure_schema_across_different_stores_does_not_race``
# rather than merely passing by luck.
