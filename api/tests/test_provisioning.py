"""The account-provisioning claim (issue #172).

What these prove: that exactly one caller per address is told it may create an
account, that the winner is decided by the **folded** address so case variants
collide, that phases only move forwards, and that an unfinished claim stays
visible instead of being swept away.

The load-bearing test is
:func:`test_live_two_requests_for_one_address_yield_one_creator`. #172 records
per-address serialization as a contract, and the review that approved the
design named this as its acceptance proof — because the primitive the codebase
already had, ``pg_advisory_xact_lock``, cannot provide it: invitation rows
commit *before* provisioning starts, and that lock is gone at commit.
