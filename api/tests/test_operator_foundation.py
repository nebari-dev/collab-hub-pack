"""Operator foundation (issue #87): the two authority axes and the audited
transaction-bound execution primitive.

Coverage maps onto the R9 acceptance list:

1. **The axes are independent and each fails closed.** A non-operator cannot
   pass a platform-operator check and a non-owner cannot pass an org-owner
   check — tested separately, plus the cross cases (an operator is not
   thereby an owner, an owner is not thereby an operator).
2. **The mutation and its event row commit or roll back together** — proven
   on a live Postgres by forcing a failure on each side of the transaction
   and confirming neither write is left behind, not by inspection. The body
   cannot complete the transaction itself: the guarded connection refuses
   commit/rollback/close/autocommit, and the whole scope runs in an explicit
   transaction block only ``audited()`` can complete.
3. **Owner- and operator-initiated performances of the same action produce
   identical event rows** apart from the actor columns.
4. **No code path updates or deletes ``collab_audit_events``** — asserted
   against the source tree (the ACL cannot enforce it: the application role
   owns the table).
5. **Rows survive a restart** (read back through a brand-new pool) and are
   readable by the documented psql procedure.
6. **The documented bootstrap procedure works**: the runbook's insert grants
   an operator that the auth choke point resolves, recorded as
   ``operator.manual`` — and that operator can act **without belonging to
   any organization** (the hub-scoped context issue #89's first invite
   depends on), while every org-scoped surface fails closed for them.

Live-Postgres tests opt in with ``COLLAB_HUB_TEST_POSTGRES_URL`` exactly like
``test_collab_schema.py``; everything else runs everywhere.
