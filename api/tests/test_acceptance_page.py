"""The browser invitation-acceptance page (issue #90).

What these prove, and what they deliberately do not.

**Proven here (the half the application owns, per the issue's ⚠️):** the
one-time secret never appears in a request line, a query string, a path, a
``Referer``, a rendered document, or any log record this application emits —
across success and every terminal state; the acceptance page is the only path
on the browser surface whose CSP permits script, and it permits exactly one
SHA-256 digest which is re-derived from the served bytes; the page is
reachable without a session while its redemption endpoint is not; and the
server half of the registration round trip works — an anonymous visit, a real
OIDC sign-in against the live stub IdP, and a redemption on the way back.

**Also proven, after gate 1:** a redemption never runs on a stale
verified-address assertion. A live, valid session whose ``email_verified`` was
recorded more than
:data:`~collab_hub_api.web.session.VERIFIED_CLAIM_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` ago is
refused by the *endpoint* — not merely warned about by the page — and the
re-authentication it sends the person through really does re-read the claims:
the IdP withdraws the verification mid-test and the renewed session carries
the withdrawal. The real-time bound is
:data:`~collab_hub_api.web.session.VERIFIED_CLAIM_WORST_CASE_AGE_SECONDS`,
which is the nominal window plus the replica clock skew the codec allows, and
a test demonstrates the skewed case rather than asserting the arithmetic only.

**Also proven, after gate 2:** the request-size limit binds what is actually
read, not what the caller declares — a chunked body with no ``Content-Length``
and a ``Content-Length`` that understates the body are both refused — and no
unbounded read is delegated either, because a non-JSON content type is
refused before ``require_csrf`` could reach its form-parsing fallback.

**Not proven here, and not provable at this level:** that a gateway
configured to log request bodies does not capture the token. It would. That
is an internal issue, verified against the running
deployment.

**Not executed here:** the page's JavaScript. There is no browser in this
suite, so the script is asserted as a *contract* — it is a compile-time
constant, so its text can be checked for the properties that matter (it
strips the fragment, it POSTs a JSON body, it never builds a URL from the
token, it names no state the page does not render) and its digest can be
checked against the CSP. Browser execution belongs to a manual pass against
the live deployment.

    keeping in the test rather than in a commit message, because a future
    reader measuring "does it close" would conclude the fix is unnecessary.

    64 KiB is deliberate: comfortably past the 2 KiB cap, and small enough to
