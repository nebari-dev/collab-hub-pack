"""Per-path request protection driven by the configured protection map.

Route-level dependencies protect the API routers, but they cannot protect what
they do not decorate: ``/`` and ``/metrics`` were reachable without credentials
and relied on the Nebari gateway (``enforceAtGateway``) to keep browsers out.
Behind an ordinary Ingress there is no gateway, so that reliance turns into a
public metrics endpoint (issue #60).

The fix is a middleware that consults a protection map — a list of path rules
supplied as configuration — before the request is routed, and a default that
applies to every path no rule matches. The map is data so the browser surface
coming in issue #88 can add ``/invite/accept`` as public, or an operator can
open ``/metrics`` to an in-cluster scraper, without touching this module.

Matching is longest-match with exact rules winning over prefix rules, so a
broad ``/`` prefix rule can be narrowed by a more specific entry. Among rules
of equal specificity the last one listed wins, which lets an operator append an
override to the built-in map rather than restate it.
