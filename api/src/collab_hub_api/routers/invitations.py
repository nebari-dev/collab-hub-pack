"""The invitation HTTP surface: issue, list, revoke, and body-based accept.

Issue #89. Seven routes, in three groups, and the grouping *is* the
authorization design rather than a URL-tidiness preference:

- ``/v1/operator/invitations…`` — guarded by
  :func:`~..frames.authorization.requires_platform_role`. An operator may
  invite into any organization or into none at all.
- ``/v1/orgs/{org_id}/invitations…`` — guarded by
  :func:`~..frames.authorization.requires_org_role` with ``org_arg="org_id"``,
  so the organization is a path parameter the guard pins to the caller's own.
  An owner naming somebody else's organization is refused by the wrapper
  before the handler exists, and there is no request shape in which an owner
  can issue an org-creating invitation: that surface has no "no organization"
  spelling at all.
- ``/v1/invitations/accept`` — no role guard, because the caller has no role
  yet. Authority is holding the one-time secret *and* controlling the
  verified mailbox it was sent to, both checked inside the acceptance
  transaction.

The two management groups call the *same* service methods with the same
arguments, so an operator-issued and an owner-issued ``invitation.send`` row
differ only in ``actor``/``actor_label``. Neither this module nor the service
writes an audit row or makes an authorization decision of its own — #87 owns
both, and this issue composes them.

**Decorator order is load-bearing.** Every guard sits *below* its
``@router.…`` decorator, nearest the function. Decorators apply bottom-up, so
a guard placed above the route decorator wraps the object the route already
holds and enforces nothing; ``verify_protected_routes(app)``, called from
``make_app``, turns that mistake into a failed startup instead of an open
route.

Token safety (R3)
-----------------
- The raw secret is minted in the service, returned to the create handler,
  handed to the email adapter, and dropped. It is in **no** response body:
  the desktop settings UI is built against these responses and must never be
  able to display or forward a live invitation.
- Acceptance takes the secret in a **POST body** — never a path segment,
  query parameter, or header — so no request line, access log, `Referer`, or
  proxy URL log can carry it. The access log records the matched route
  template, which is a constant.
- A 422 on the accept route has its ``details`` dropped, because pydantic
  echoes the rejected input value back and an almost-valid token in a 422
  body is a token in whatever logs response bodies. That redaction lives in
  ``core.make_app``; :func:`redact_validation_details` is the predicate.
- Nothing here logs the token, and no error message interpolates it. Errors
  name the invitation *id*, which is opaque and safe to quote.

Email delivery is sequenced **after** the audited transaction commits, per
#87's contract: an unrecoverable side effect must never run inside a block
that can roll back, because a rollback cannot un-send a message. The cost is
the other direction — a committed invitation whose delivery failed — which is
recoverable and is reported in the create response instead of hidden.

that a value which is *already* boxed is unwrapped before the constraints see
it, which is what makes revalidation idempotent.

The consequence for introspection: ``model_fields["token"].annotation`` is
``str``, so a static "does this field hold the wrapper?" check cannot see it.

"""


class InvitationAcceptRequest(BaseModel):
    """Accept body: the raw one-time secret, and nothing else.

    This is the one model in the system that holds a **live** credential, and
    what protects it is the *type of the field*, not a list of patched exits.
    ``token`` is an :class:`~..frames.credentials.InvitationSecret`, so
    anything that walks the model generically — ``vars()``, ``__dict__``,
    ``json.dumps(..., default=vars)``, a ``repr``, FastAPI's response
    encoder, a traceback that captures locals — finds an object that redacts
    itself and refuses to be copied, pickled, or mutated.

    Model-level protections sit on top, because pydantic reads and writes
    fields through its own machinery rather than through the object:

    - the field serializer covers ``model_dump`` and ``model_dump_json``,
      which ignore ``repr`` settings entirely, and dumping a request model is
      the single most routine thing anyone does when adding request logging;
    - ``__getstate__`` refuses pickling of the model itself, so the failure
      names the model instead of surfacing from somewhere inside pydantic;
    - ``frozen=True`` closes assignment, which does not validate by default —
      ``payload.token = raw`` would otherwise put a bare string back in;
    - :meth:`model_construct` and :meth:`model_copy` box explicitly, because
      **both skip validation by design** and would otherwise leave a raw
      ``str`` in the model's ``__dict__``, where a locals-capturing traceback
      would print it. ``model_construct`` is not exotic — it is exactly what
      someone reaches for to skip validation on a hot path — so the field's
      after-validator cannot be the only thing that boxes.

    The value stays usable in-process as ``payload.token.reveal()``, which is
    the only *supported* way to read it. Stated at the same width as
    :class:`~..frames.credentials.InvitationSecret`'s own guarantee, and no
    wider: what is closed is **accidental** escape through machinery that
    walks the model generically. Code that deliberately reaches past the
    model — ``object.__setattr__``, a direct ``__dict__`` write — is not
    defended against and does not need to be, since it could call
    ``.reveal()`` instead.

    What is *proven*, rather than asserted universally: every public entry
    point on ``BaseModel`` that builds or mutates an instance either boxes
    the token or refuses. The list is enumerated from the installed class and
    exercised one by one — ``__init__``, ``model_validate``,
    ``model_validate_json``, ``model_validate_strings``, ``model_construct``,
    ``model_copy``, ``__replace__``, ``__copy__``, ``__deepcopy__``,
    ``__setattr__``, ``__setstate__``, and the deprecated-but-live
    ``construct``, ``copy``, ``parse_obj``, ``parse_raw``, ``parse_file``,
    ``validate``, and ``from_orm``. A test compares that list against the
    installed ``BaseModel``, so a pydantic upgrade adding a public method
    fails rather than slipping past unaudited, and a second test pins the
    entry points that cannot honestly be reclassified as read-only, so the
    audit cannot be defined into passing.

    Covered alongside them: a **subtype** redeclaring ``token: str``, whose
    instance ``model_validate`` and ``TypeAdapter`` would otherwise return
    untouched. ``revalidate_instances="always"`` is what closes that, and it
    is a different kind of hole from the rest — not an entry point that
    forgot to box, but a value arriving already inside a model.

    Both checks exist because of what earlier audits missed. The first
    reasoned *backwards* from the ``__dict__`` write sites it could find and
    concluded the field was safe, while the deprecated ``copy(update=...)``
    reached ``__dict__`` by a third route
    (``pydantic/deprecated/copy_internals.py``, which does not go through
    :meth:`model_copy`). The second enumerated entry points forwards and was
    right about all of them, and still missed the subtype — because no entry
    point was at fault.

    Extracted for the browser acceptance page (#90), which authenticates with
    a web session cookie instead of an API credential and therefore cannot
    call the route above — but must not grow a second opinion about how
    redemption works. Everything that decides an outcome stays in the
    lifecycle service; this function only unboxes the secret, hashes it,
    passes the digest on, and — since #180 — grants the service groups an
    acceptance carries.

    The raw string exists in exactly one expression, as the argument to
    :func:`~..frames.invitations.hash_invitation_secret`, which cannot raise
    for a body the accept model validated (ASCII, bounded, ``token_urlsafe``
    alphabet) — so it is never bound to a local that a traceback could print.

    **The grant is sequenced after the acceptance, deliberately (#180).** It is
    not inside the audited transaction and must never be: a group write cannot
    be rolled back, and an identity-provider outage must not cost somebody a
    membership they hold a valid invitation and a verified address for. So the
    acceptance commits first and the grant is attempted against it — the same
    ordering, and the same reasoning, as invitation delivery (#87/#89).

    A failed grant therefore leaves an accepted invitation with no service
    access. That is the right trade and the wrong silence, so **the acceptance
    transaction records what it owes** before the external call happens: a
    ``pending`` row per group, committed with the acceptance itself. The
    attempt then settles that row to ``granted`` or ``failed``, and a failure
    is additionally logged at ``error`` with the invitation id.

    Writing the intent first is what makes this reconcilable rather than merely
    reported. Every point at which the process can stop — before the call,
    after it, or during the settle — leaves the row ``pending``, which
    :meth:`~..frames.invitations.PostgresInvitationService.outstanding_service_access_grants`
    returns; retrying is safe because a group add is idempotent. The invitee is
    told "you are in", which is true, and the grant they are still owed is a
    row rather than a support message.
