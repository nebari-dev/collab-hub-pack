"""The owner invitation routes (issue #142) — the first owner action.

Four routes on the browser surface, all under ``/web/org``, all requiring a
web session *and* an active ``role = 'owner'`` membership:

``GET  /web/org/invitations``           the page and the listing
``POST /web/org/invitations``           issue one invitation into the caller's org
``POST /web/org/invitations/revoke``    revoke one of the caller's org's
``POST /web/org/invitations/name``      give a placeholder-named org its name (#188)

The naming route is the first-invite naming flow #92 specified and #142 did
not ship: every organization starts with the neutral placeholder name, so an
owner reaching this page for the first time owns "Unnamed organization", and
an invitation issued then words that placeholder into the invitee's email
(observed live, #188). While the placeholder stands the page renders the
naming form instead of the issue form, and ``POST /web/org/invitations``
refuses to issue: a submission that passes the page's ordinary request checks
(bounded body, CSRF, a valid address) is answered **409** before the issue
action and before delivery, and a submission that fails those checks is
answered as it always was — so no body shape reaches issuance. The refusal
is the server's; the hidden form is just its honest rendering. Naming is
one-shot and audited as ``org.rename``; see
:meth:`~..frames.invitations.PostgresInvitationService.name_organization`.

The pattern is issue #91's, instantiated for the org axis — see
:mod:`..web.owner` for what carries over and what the axis changes.
Concretely, in this file:

* the router carries ``Depends(require_org_owner)``, so **every** route on it
  refuses a signed-in non-owner with the surface's own 403 page rather than a
  404, a blank page, or an API error envelope;
* the three things this page can *do* are plain functions carrying #87's
  ``@requires_org_role(ROLE_OWNER, org_arg="org_id")`` guard, so the
  authority check lives on the action, is pinned to the organization the call
  names, and holds wherever the function is called from;
* the organization those guards are pinned to is resolved per request by
  :func:`~..web.owner.owner_context` from the caller's own membership row —
  never a form field, never a path segment an owner could vary. The wrapper
  compares it against the context's ``home_org_id``, which came from the same
  resolution, and ``expect_org_id`` re-asserts it inside the revoke
  transaction;
* neither this module nor the page writes an audit row. ``audited()`` is the
  only writer of ``collab_audit_events``, composed inside #89's lifecycle
  service, and an owner-issued ``invitation.send`` row is identical to an
  operator-issued one apart from ``actor``/``actor_label`` and ``org_id``.

The secret
----------
Issuing calls the invitation service **in this process** — no HTTP client, no
self-request, no dependence on the ``/v1`` router being mounted — and the raw
secret then travels exactly one route: it is handed to
``InvitationEmailDelivery.deliver`` (the adapter #89's API route uses) and
dropped. The page renders the sanitized outcome and never the token.

This page once had a second mode that rendered the link instead, on a
deployment with no provider, through ``web/invite_link.py``. That module's end
condition is met and it is deleted; a deployment with no provider now gets a
visible failed send, which is the correct answer once mail is the delivery
channel. ``configured`` survives as the page's *warning* — the owner is told
before issuing, not after.

What reaches a log: the subject, the invitation **id**, and a fixed reason
word — never the token, never the submitted address. Request bodies are
bounded and parsed by :mod:`..web.forms`, shared with the operator page,
which keeps every property that module's docstring argues for (counting
rather than trusting ``Content-Length``, no ``request.form()`` anywhere, and
``Connection: close`` on a refusal issued before the body was read).
