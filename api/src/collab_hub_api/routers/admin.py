"""The operator invitation routes (issue #91) — the first operator action.

Three routes on the browser surface, all under ``/admin``, all requiring a web
session *and* ``platform_role = 'operator'``:

``GET  /admin/invitations``           the page and the listing
``POST /admin/invitations``           issue one invitation
``POST /admin/invitations/revoke``    revoke one

The pattern this sets, which future operator actions copy
---------------------------------------------------------
See :mod:`..web.operator` for the reasoning. Concretely, in this file:

* the router carries ``Depends(require_operator)``, so **every** route on it —
  the page included — refuses a signed-in non-operator with the surface's own
  403 page rather than a 404, a blank page, or an API error envelope;
* the two things this page can *do* are plain functions carrying #87's
  ``@requires_platform_role`` guard, so the authority check lives on the action
  and holds wherever the function is called from. Its refusal is #87's plain
  ``HTTPException`` and therefore API-shaped rather than page-shaped, which is
  correct: it is the **backstop**, unreachable while the router dependency
  above it stands, and if it ever does fire the honest answer is a refusal that
  does not look like a designed part of the flow;
* the authority those guards read is resolved per request by
  :func:`~..web.operator.operator_context`, never asserted by this module. The
  role is therefore resolved twice on a mutating request — once by the router's
  ``require_operator``, once building the context — and that is the intended
  cost of the guard deciding a fact rather than restating an assumption;
* neither this module nor the page writes an audit row. ``audited()`` is the
  only writer of ``collab_audit_events``, composed inside #89's lifecycle
  service, and an operator-issued ``invitation.send`` row is identical to an
  owner-issued one apart from ``actor``/``actor_label``. A page that had to
  write its own row would mean the foundation was wrong, and the fix would be
  the foundation.

The token, and why it never leaves this process except to the mail adapter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
:func:`issue_invitation` calls the invitation service **in this process**, the
same call #89's API route makes, and receives the raw secret as its return
value. There is no HTTP client here, no self-request, and no dependence on the
``/v1`` router being mounted — the page issues invitations on a deployment
where that router does not exist, which is what makes "the token did not
arrive over HTTP" a property rather than a claim.

The secret is then handed to ``InvitationEmailDelivery.deliver`` — the adapter
#89's API route uses — and dropped. The page renders the sanitized outcome
(sent / could not be sent / unconfirmed) and never the token.

Until invitation mail was deliverable, this path did the opposite: it rendered
the redemption link through ``web/invite_link.py`` for an operator to send by
hand, and suppressed the send, because one single-use secret travelling two
routes doubles its exposure and makes "was it sent?" ambiguous. That was the
relaxation the 2026-08-07 amendment to #91 granted, on its own end condition
(an internal issue). The condition is met, the module is
deleted, and the send is restored in the same edit — one secret, one route.

What reaches a log
------------------
The subject, the invitation **id**, and a fixed reason word. Never the token,
never a message from an exception that was raised near one, and never the
submitted address: an id is opaque, is what the audit row already quotes, and
is what anyone reading such a line actually needs.

Request-size limits
-------------------
Both ``POST`` bodies are refused above :data:`MAX_FORM_BYTES` **by counting what
arrives**, not by trusting ``Content-Length``. The header is a fast path and
nothing more: a chunked request carries none, so a header-only check was no
limit at all against exactly the caller it needed to bound — 2,000,000 bytes
went through a 4,096-byte cap. The bound now lives in
:mod:`..web.request_limits`, shared with the acceptance page (#90), which had
already fixed the same defect; two implementations of one limit is how the
second one gets it wrong. The parsing-and-checking layer above it moved to
:mod:`..web.forms` when the owner page (#142) became its second caller, for
the same reason, and the properties below are now that module's to keep.

Neither route calls ``request.form()``. The body is read under the cap and the
urlencoded fields are parsed from those bytes, so Starlette's unbounded form
parse is not on either path — which also means #119's fix to ``require_csrf``
has nothing to reach here.

A refusal issued **before** the body was read closes the connection. Answering
without reading to end-of-message otherwise leaves the server stalled on that
connection until something times out, which is the same exhaustion moved from
memory to sockets. See :func:`~..web.request_limits.connection_close_headers`.

That is the cheap abuse control milestone decision #116 keeps on the 12 August
bar: it protects the server rather than the user population, which is the part
strict invitation does not already cover.
