"""The OCI Distribution read API on the Hub host (issue #179): Cog pulls through the Hub.

Mounted only when ``cogs.serve.enabled``. Standard clients (``nebi``,
``oras``, ``docker``) speak to it unchanged:

- ``GET|HEAD /v2/`` -- the version check, and where an unauthenticated client
  learns how to authenticate;
- ``GET|HEAD /v2/<name>/manifests/<reference>`` -- by tag or by digest;
- ``GET|HEAD /v2/<name>/blobs/<digest>``;
- ``GET /v2/<name>/tags/list``;
- ``GET /v2/token`` -- the distribution token endpoint.

What is served, and how a blob is shown to be reachable, is
:mod:`..cogs.serving`; this module is the HTTP surface: authentication, the
OCI error format, and streaming.

**Authentication.** Every ``/v2/`` route requires ``Authorization: Bearer
<pull token>`` and answers ``401`` with a ``WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
realm="<hub>/v2/token",service="<registry host>"[,scope="repository:<name>:pull"]``
challenge otherwise. The token endpoint mints a pull token for either

- HTTP Basic auth with a **registry credential** (exchanged at ``POST
  /v1/cogs/registry-credentials``), which is what ``docker login`` /
  ``nebi registry add`` store; or
- a Hub credential the API already accepts (a bearer access token, the
  gateway's ``IdToken-*`` cookie), for a client that attaches it per request
  and never stores it.

A pull token is checked on every request, and so is its owner: on a
membership-resolving deployment the owner's current membership is read again
each time (:func:`require_admitted`), so a member removed after a token was
minted is refused on the next request, not when the token expires.

The path-protection middleware does not run on ``/v2``: its refusal is the
Hub API's JSON envelope, and a registry client needs the challenge above to
find the token endpoint at all. Nothing here is reachable without one of the
two credentials.

**Nothing about the backing registry leaves this module.** Bodies are either
the artifact's own bytes or an error written here; upstream error bodies are
never read, upstream headers are never copied, and upstream redirects are
followed by the Hub's OCI client rather than relayed.

**Streaming.** A blob is relayed chunk by chunk, hashed as it passes, and
its last chunk is held until the hash and the length have been checked, so
a blob that fails verification reaches the client short, never complete and
wrong. Every request runs under one aggregate deadline, from its first
lookup: ``cogs.serve.max_blob_seconds`` for a blob body, thirty seconds for
everything else. The response owns the open upstream blob and closes it
however the exchange ends.
