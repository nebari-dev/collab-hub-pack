"""The browser invitation-acceptance routes (issue #90).

Two routes, and the split between them is the security design rather than URL
tidiness:

``GET /invite/accept``
    The page. **Anonymous by design** — its audience is people with no
    account on this deployment yet — and therefore listed in
    :data:`~..web.surface.PUBLIC_WEB_PATHS`, which is the surface's one
    reviewed way to be public. It is safe to serve anonymously because it is
    a static document: it reads nothing from the request, holds no invitation
    state, and the one-time secret the whole flow is about does not reach the
    server on this request at all — it is in the URL fragment, which browsers
    never transmit.

``POST /invite/accept/redeem``
    The act. Requires a web session (the guard enforces it by path, and
    :func:`~..web.authz.require_csrf` again in-route), takes the secret in a
    **JSON body**, and answers a fixed outcome word the page turns into copy.

Freshness of the verified address
---------------------------------
Holding a session is not enough to redeem. The session's ``email`` and
``email_verified`` are one half of #89's authority pair, and unlike the
subject they are facts about the account *at the IdP* that the IdP can
withdraw. A session lasts eight hours; a membership lasts forever (one
organization per login, no change afterwards). Acting on an assertion up to a
whole session old could therefore bind a permanent membership on a
verification that had already been revoked.

So the redemption endpoint requires the assertion to be recent
(:data:`~..web.session.VERIFIED_CLAIM_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`) and otherwise answers
``reauthentication_required``, which sends the person back through the
authorization-code flow so the IdP mints a **new** ID token from the current
user record — usually invisibly, off their existing SSO session. This surface
cannot simply re-read the IdP: it keeps no access or refresh token, and
acquiring one to close this would be a larger regression than the gap.

What that buys, stated no wider than it is: the assertion a redemption acts on
was minted by the IdP within
:data:`~..web.session.VERIFIED_CLAIM_WORST_CASE_AGE_SECONDS` (six minutes —
five nominal, plus the sixty seconds of replica clock skew the session codec
allows), not up to eight hours earlier. It is a bound, not "as of this
instant": nothing short of reading the IdP inside the redemption transaction
gives that, and no OIDC relying party has it.

They are two paths rather than two methods on one path because the guard's
public exemption is keyed on the path and knows nothing about methods:
sharing a path would have made the redemption endpoint anonymous as a side
effect of making the page anonymous.

Token handling (R3), stated as what is actually proven here
-----------------------------------------------------------
* The secret arrives in a **POST body**. It is in no request line, no path,
  no query string, no header, and no ``Referer`` — the page's own script
  never builds a URL from it, and the surface sends ``Referrer-Policy:
  no-referrer`` on every response anyway.
* The body is parsed by hand in :func:`_accept_request`, not declared as a
  FastAPI body model. A pydantic ``ValidationError`` carries the **rejected
  input** in its ``errors()``, which is how an almost-valid one-time secret
  ends up in a 422 body and from there in anything that logs bodies. Hand
  parsing means that machinery never sees the value.
* Every exception inside that function is caught inside it, so no traceback
  whose frame holds the bare string ever propagates. Above it, the token
  exists only as an :class:`~..frames.credentials.InvitationSecret` inside
  :class:`~.invitations.InvitationAcceptRequest`, which redacts itself from
  every repr, dump, and serializer.
* Nothing logged here interpolates the body. The log line records the
  outcome word and the subject, both of which are safe to quote.

What this deliberately does **not** claim: that a gateway configured to log
request bodies will not capture the token. It will, and no application-level
test can show otherwise. That half belongs to the deployment and is tracked
as an internal issue.

    could compose would be composed next to a variable holding a live

    from the request can appear in a response body.

    ``body_consumed`` is **required**, with no default, and it decides whether
    the connection survives the response. Answering an HTTP/1.1 request whose
    body has not been read to end-of-message leaves the server unable to start
    the next cycle on that connection: it buffers what the client is still
    sending up to its high-water mark and then stalls, holding the connection
    until something times out. On the oversize path that is the exact failure
    being defended against, moved from memory to connections — a caller who
    keeps sending ties up a connection per request, and the size cap that
    stopped the memory problem is what creates it.

    So a refusal issued before the body was read closes the connection, which
    is what a 413 conventionally does anyway. Draining instead would mean
    reading past the cap, which is the original problem again; draining to a
    second bound and *then* closing is a strictly more complicated way to
    reach the same place.

    No default, because the safe value depends on where the call sits and a
    new refusal path added above the read would silently inherit the wrong
    one. Being made to answer the question is the point.
