"""Routes for the browser web surface (issue #88): session sign-in and scaffolding.

Mounted by ``make_app`` only when a confidential web client is configured
(``web.client_id``). All routes live under ``/web`` and are **public at the
protection-map level** — the map's credential check is the API one (IdToken
cookie / bearer token), which a browser mid-sign-in cannot pass — and enforce
their own session, CSRF, and role checks in-route, the same way the API
routers enforce theirs with dependencies. ``enforce_web_surface_preconditions``
refuses startup if the map does not actually leave the prefix public.

The pages this issue ships are deliberately minimal: sign-in, an overview page
proving a session works, sign-out. The invitation pages (#90–#92) mount their
own routers on the dependencies and layout this surface exports.

    whether or not its author remembered to say so; ``public_router`` holds

    must render for an anonymous browser.

    The protection map cannot supply this default: its ``authenticated`` level
    runs the *API* credential check, which a browser mid-sign-in cannot pass,
