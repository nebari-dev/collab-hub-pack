"""The admin panel's JSON endpoints.

Everything the panel reads and writes goes through here, on the browser axis:
the session cookie authenticates, the operator role authorizes, and mutations
carry the ``X-CSRF-Token`` header that :func:`~..web.authz.require_csrf`
already knows how to read.

Why this is not under ``/v1``
-----------------------------
See :data:`~..web.surface.ADMIN_API_PREFIX`. The short version is that the rule
this codebase keeps is not "JSON belongs to the API" but "browser credentials
do not work on the machine API, and machine credentials do not sign a browser
in". A panel running in a browser is a browser client.

The practical gain is the guard. ``/admin`` is a guarded prefix, and
:class:`~..web.guard.WebSessionGuardMiddleware` validates the session cookie by
path, before routing, consulting no route and no dependency -- so an endpoint
added here without its dependency is still authenticated. ``/v1`` has no such
middleware and relies on each route carrying its own, which is the arrangement
the guard module was rewritten to stop depending on.

The router still carries ``require_operator``, for the reason the operator
invitation page carries it: the guard decides *authentication*, and authority
is a separate question that must be asked on every route of this surface.
