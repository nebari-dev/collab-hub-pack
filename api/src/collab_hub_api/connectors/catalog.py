"""What a client is told about each connector this hub offers.

``GET /v1/connectors`` is how a client discovers connectors: it lists the ones
this deployment can actually serve, with everything needed to show one to a
user and start connecting it. A client that renders from that response needs no
connector list of its own, so a deployment decides what its users see.

This module holds the two halves of that answer that are not the caller's
connection state: the fixed description of each connector, and the
per-deployment facts read from configuration (is it offered, and which identity
provider does a user link).
