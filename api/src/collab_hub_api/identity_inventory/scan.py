"""Every place the Frames server persists an identity string, and how to read it.

:data:`CARRIERS` is the authoritative list — eighteen storage sites plus one
catch-all sweep row — and it is deliberately annotated with *provenance*: which
of them issue #65 named, which issue #61 found while writing its pin, and which
this audit found by walking ``release/public``. That column is not decoration: a
migration report is only as trustworthy as its coverage, and an operator reading
it has to be able to see that the tool went looking somewhere the issue did not
think to mention.

Several carriers are JSON documents rather than columns — ``history.detail``,
``usage_events.detail``, ``task_state.payload``, ``task_devices.payload``, and
the frame sidecar itself — and a named-field read cannot cover those, as this
tool found the hard way: ``nexus_task_state.payload`` was scanned while
``nexus_task_devices.payload``, holding the same shape of record, was missed.
So every JSON document is now swept whole, with two rules:

* **by key** — a string under a key that is identity-bearing by construction
  (``actor``, ``added``/``removed`` from ``list_diff``, ``owner_id``, …);
* **by value** — a string that is *equal to a principal already found in a
  structural carrier*.

The second rule is what catches shapes nobody anticipated, without flooding the
report with frame names and tag values. Both rules record the JSON path and the
event name so a reviewer can judge a false positive at a glance — and since
nothing is ever rewritten, a false positive costs a line of report, not access.
