"""Rendering: a report a person reads, and a JSON file a tool reads.

The Markdown report is the deliverable. Someone has to sit with it against real
internal-hub data and decide whether Gate D may proceed, so it is ordered by
what that decision needs:

1. the verdict, and every reason it is not ``clear``;
2. **coverage** — what was scanned and, more importantly, what was not, because
   an unscanned source is an unproven claim rather than an absence of findings,
   and it alone forces a non-clear verdict;
3. the **orphan check**, with every finding named and locatable;
4. mappings that cannot be trusted on their own: ambiguity, suspected
   reassignment, and unverified matches;
5. unmapped principals, with the explicit statement that they stay put;
6. the proposed rewrite, labelled with confidence, so the mapping can be
   spot-checked;
7. carrier inventory, including which issue named each carrier.

**Personal data.** The report necessarily lists emails and usernames — that is
what a stored principal *is* — so the rendered file is personal data about staff
and should be handled like the production access records it describes: written
``0600``, kept out of tickets and chat, and deleted once Gate D is decided.
``--redact`` replaces every principal, subject, account label, and every
occurrence of one embedded inside an entity id or a storage path with a stable
``principal:<sha256 prefix>``, so counts, carriers, and orphan structure can be
shared without the identities. That is pseudonymisation, not anonymisation — a
reviewer holding the user list can reverse it — and the redacted report is
therefore safer to circulate, not safe to publish.
