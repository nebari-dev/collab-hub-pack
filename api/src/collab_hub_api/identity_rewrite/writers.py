"""The writes themselves: substitution, primary-key merges, and the manifest.

Every function here takes the substitution table as data and returns what it
changed. Nothing derives a mapping, and nothing decides whether a principal is
safe to rewrite — :mod:`.plan` did that, in front of a person.

Three properties are load-bearing, and each exists because its absence was
demonstrated rather than imagined:

* **A match is only substituted where an identity belongs.** The document is
  still swept whole — that is how the scanner found the carrier its first draft
  missed — but a value equal to a mapped principal is *rewritten* only under an
  identity-bearing key. A ``description`` that happens to equal an address is
  reported and left alone; nothing is corrupted while the operator decides.
* **A change is recorded only once its write has succeeded.** An entry for a
  write that failed or rolled back makes the record untrue, so planned, pending,
  committed and failed are distinct states.

  The manifest is a **diagnostic and targeted-reversal aid, not the authoritative
  rollback mechanism.** It is written at startup and at termination, so an
  abruptly killed run can leave committed file or object writes unrecorded, and
  it is per-run rather than a durable journal. After an interrupted run the
  authoritative description of what is stored is a fresh read-only inventory,
  and the authoritative way back is verified database and frame-store
  backup/restore. See :mod:`collab_hub_api.identity_rewrite` for the contract
  this deliberately does not claim.
* **Local writes stay inside the configured root, and land atomically.** A
  planted ``metadata.json`` symlink otherwise rewrites a file outside the store,
  and an interrupted in-place write leaves a truncated sidecar.
