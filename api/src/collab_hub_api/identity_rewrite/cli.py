"""Command line entry point: ``python -m collab_hub_api.identity_rewrite``.

Configuration comes from the **same environment variables the API pod already
has**, exactly as the inventory does, so the documented way to run this is
inside the deployment being migrated with no new configuration to get wrong.

Exit codes gate a runbook step:

- ``0`` — planned (dry run) or applied, with no errors.
- ``1`` — the report was refused, or a waiver is missing. Nothing was written.
- ``2`` — the run failed partway. **The manifest is still written**, and it is
  the record of what had already changed.

The manifest destination is reserved *before* the first mutation, not written at
the end: an unsafe or unwritable path discovered after the data has changed
leaves a migration with no record at all.

**The manifest is a diagnostic and targeted-reversal aid, not the authoritative
rollback.** It is written at startup and at termination, so a run killed abruptly
can leave committed writes unrecorded. After an interrupted run, re-read the
store with the read-only inventory and fall back to the snapshot — which is why
the runbook takes one first.

The default is a dry run; ``--apply`` is the only way to write.

**Quiescing the deployment is the operator's job, and this tool cannot check
it.** Nothing here detects a running API, so the runbook scales it to zero
first: a write that lands mid-rewrite is recorded under a legacy principal that
no longer exists anywhere else, and no exit code will tell you it happened.
