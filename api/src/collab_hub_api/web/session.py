"""The browser session cookie: a signed, expiring identity assertion.

Design decisions, stated once:

* **Stateless and signed, not a server-side session table.** The cookie's
  payload is JSON, HMAC-SHA256 signed with the deployment's
  ``web.session_secret``, so any replica can verify it with no shared store
  and no schema change (the ``collab_`` migrations are another issue's merge
  hot spot). The trade this buys is documented rather than hidden: the server
  cannot revoke an individual session before it expires — sign-out deletes
  the browser's copy, and a copy captured before sign-out keeps verifying
  until ``exp``. That is acceptable *here* because the cookie asserts only
  identity: every authorization decision (operator, org owner) is re-resolved
  from the server's own stores on each request (``web.authz``), so revoking a
  role locks the holder out immediately, valid session or not. The absolute
  lifetime is deliberately short (``web.session_lifetime_seconds``, default
  eight hours) and there is no sliding renewal.

* **The CSRF secret lives inside the session payload.** The cookie is
  HttpOnly, so page script (and any injected script) cannot read it; pages
  render the token into forms server-side and POST handlers compare it
  against the session's copy in constant time. A token is therefore valid for
  exactly one session and dies with it — nothing to store, nothing to rotate
  separately.

* **Purpose tags.** The session codec also signs the transient OIDC-flow
  cookie (state/nonce/PKCE verifier), and the two must never be mutually
  substitutable: a signature is computed over ``purpose || "." || payload``,
  so a transient blob presented as a session cookie (or vice versa) fails
  verification outright.

* **``__Host-`` cookie names, always ``Secure``.** ``__Host-`` makes the
  browser itself refuse the cookie unless it is Secure, Path=/, and set by
  this exact host — a subdomain or an http origin cannot plant one. There is
  deliberately no "insecure cookies for dev" switch: modern browsers treat
  ``localhost`` as a secure context and accept Secure cookies over plain http
  there, so the switch would only ever weaken a real deployment.

"""How old the session's ``email``/``email_verified`` assertion may be when it
is used as an **authorization input**.

Identity in this cookie is stable — a subject does not stop being that
subject — which is why an eight-hour session is acceptable for it. The
verified-address pair is different in kind: it is a fact about the account at
the IdP *right now*, and it can be revoked there. Invitation acceptance is the
one place on this surface that decides something on it, and what it decides is
permanent (one organization per login, no change afterwards). An assertion up
to a whole session old could therefore bind a membership on a verification the
IdP had already withdrawn.

**Where verification is not required, half of this reasoning stops applying and
the gate stays.** On a deployment with
``frames.invitations.require_verified_email`` off (#45), acceptance no longer
reads ``email_verified`` as an authorization input at all, so nothing can bind a
membership on a withdrawn verification. What still matters is the ``email``
claim's currency: it *is* an authorization input in both modes -- Gate B's match
is not configurable -- and an address can be reassigned at the IdP just as a
verification can be revoked. So the bound is unchanged and its stricter
justification is simply unused there. Left as it is deliberately: a re-auth
round trip is a small cost, and loosening a window because one of two reasons
went away is how a bound stops meaning anything.

This surface cannot read the IdP at will — it holds no access or refresh
token, deliberately (``web.oidc``), and acquiring one to fix this would be a
larger regression than the problem. What it can do is re-run the
authorization-code flow, which makes Keycloak mint a **new ID token from the
current user record**. That is usually invisible: an active SSO session
satisfies it without prompting, and the claims still come out current, because
protocol mappers read the user at token-mint time rather than at sign-in.

This is the bound **measured against the deciding replica's own clock**. It is
not the real-time worst case, and the difference is not rounding — see
:data:`VERIFIED_CLAIM_WORST_CASE_AGE_SECONDS`, which is the number any claim
about this should quote. Lower is safer; the only cost of lowering it is more
redirect round trips.

The gap is :data:`CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS`. The codec deliberately accepts an
``iat`` up to that far in the future, so a session minted by a replica running
at the skew limit carries an ``issued_at`` ahead of real time by that much,
and the age this module computes understates the real one by the same amount.
Everything still terminates — the clamp in
:func:`verified_claims_are_current` stops a future ``iat`` from meaning
"fresh forever" — but "no more than five minutes" was not true, and the
honest number is six.

Stated here, in the code, rather than only in a document: the next person to
reason about this will reason from the constant, and a constant that means
something narrower than its name is how a documented bound quietly becomes
wrong.
