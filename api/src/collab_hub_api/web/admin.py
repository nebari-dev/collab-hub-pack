"""The operator invitation page (issue #91): copy and markup.

``/admin/invitations`` — restricted to ``platform_role = 'operator'``. It does
three things and deliberately not a fourth: it takes an email address and
issues an invitation, it shows the invitations on this deployment with their
state, and it revokes one. No cross-org browsing, no member management, no org
deletion; Gate E scoped the operator surface to invitation issuance exactly,
and a page module is where extra capability arrives unnoticed.

**The page does not create the organization.** Every invitation issued here
carries a null ``org_id``, and the organization is created atomically on first
acceptance with the accepter as its owner (Gate B, revised 2026-08-04). There
is no request shape on this page that can name an organization: pre-creating
one would leave an orphan behind every invitation that is revoked, expires, or
is simply never accepted, and would move the ``org.create`` actor from the
accepter to the operator.

No JavaScript
-------------
Plain documents and forms, like the rest of the surface — the acceptance page
(#90) is the single exception and it exists for a reason this page does not
share. So ``/admin/*`` keeps :data:`~.pages.CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY` unchanged:
``default-src 'none'`` with no ``script-src`` at all. That is checked rather
than assumed; see the tests.

Why the issue ``POST`` renders instead of redirecting
-----------------------------------------------------
Every other mutating form on an operational surface should redirect after
posting, so a reload does not repeat the action. This one answers with the
page directly, because the redemption link exists for exactly one response and
carrying it through a redirect would mean putting a live secret in a URL, a
cookie, or server-side session state — three worse places than the body it is
already in. The cost is a browser "resubmit?" prompt on reload, and the
issuance rule behind it (one live invitation per address, enforced in the
service under an advisory lock) is what makes an accidental resubmit harmless.

Revoke posts to its own path and also answers with the page, for consistency
of shape rather than necessity: revoking twice is a no-op success in #89 and
writes no second audit row.
