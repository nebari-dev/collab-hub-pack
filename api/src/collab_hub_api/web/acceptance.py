"""The invitation-acceptance page (issue #90): copy, script, and its own CSP.

This is the **one page of the browser surface that runs JavaScript**, and the
reason is structural rather than a preference, so it is written down here
where the next reader will find it.

Why this page needs a script
----------------------------
The one-time invitation secret is delivered in the URL **fragment**
(``…/invite/accept#token=…``, minted by
:func:`~..frames.invitation_email.build_setup_url`). A fragment is never put
on the request line, never sent in a ``Referer``, and never reaches the
server at all — that is the whole point of choosing it, and it is what makes
the R3 claim "the token appears in no HTTP request line" true by
construction rather than by discipline.

The direct consequence: **only client-side script can read it.** A
server-rendered page cannot see the fragment, so there is no zero-JavaScript
design that also keeps the token out of the request line. The two
requirements are mutually exclusive, and R3 is the one that matters.

Why the relaxation is scoped to this path, and how
--------------------------------------------------
:mod:`.pages` sets ``default-src 'none'`` with **no** ``script-src`` at all
for the rest of the surface, and that is load-bearing: every other page is
plain documents and forms, so forbidding script outright costs nothing and
removes a whole class of injection. Widening that policy surface-wide to
serve this one page would trade a real property for a local convenience.

So the relaxation is:

* **Keyed on the path, not on a flag a handler sets.** ``/invite/accept``
  and nothing else gets the script-bearing policy; every other path on the
  surface gets :data:`~.pages.CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY` unchanged. The
  decision lives in :func:`~.pages.headers_for_path`, which the security-
  header middleware consults — the same "path in, policy out" shape the
  session guard settled on, and for the same reason: a per-response marker
  is authored by whoever might get it wrong, a path is not.
* **Pinned to a hash, not ``'unsafe-inline'`` and not ``'self'``.**
  ``script-src`` names exactly one SHA-256 digest,
  :data:`ACCEPTANCE_SCRIPT_HASH`, computed **from the bytes this module
  serves** — so the policy cannot drift from the script, and an injected
  ``<script>`` (inline *or* same-origin, since ``'self'`` is deliberately
  absent) is refused by the browser. A nonce would have been the other
  acceptable answer; a hash is stronger here because the script is a
  compile-time constant with no per-request part, so there is nothing for a
  nonce to buy and one less thing to generate correctly.
* **Every other header is unchanged.** ``Referrer-Policy: no-referrer``,
  ``Cache-Control: no-store``, ``X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff``,
  ``X-Frame-Options: DENY``, ``frame-ancestors 'none'``, ``base-uri 'none'``
  and ``default-src 'none'`` all still apply. The only additions are the
  hashed ``script-src`` and ``connect-src 'self'``, which the redemption
  ``fetch`` needs and which permits this origin and nothing else.

**If you are here to make the surface consistent: do not widen
:data:`~.pages.CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY`.** The inconsistency is the design.
Narrow the exception further if you can; never generalize it.

What the script is allowed to do with the token
------------------------------------------------
The token is read from the fragment into a JavaScript variable, stripped
from the address bar with ``history.replaceState`` immediately, kept in
``sessionStorage`` so it survives the Keycloak registration / sign-in round
trip in the same tab, and sent to the server in a **POST body**. It is never
written into the DOM, never an element value or attribute, never a query
parameter, never a form field, and never part of any URL this page
constructs.

The page's own markup is therefore fully static: every outcome is
server-rendered as a hidden ``<section data-state="…">`` and the script only
toggles the ``hidden`` attribute. There is no ``innerHTML``, no string-built
markup, and nothing derived from the token in anything the script writes.

Why redemption needs a click
----------------------------
The page could redeem the moment it loads — the person did, after all, click
a link in their email. It deliberately does not, and the reason is that
**joining an organization is permanent in this beta**: one organization per
login, and it does not change once it is set.

Consider a page load the person did not intend. Anyone who can issue an
invitation to a known address could, instead of emailing it, get that
address's owner to open ``…/invite/accept#token=…`` — an image link, a
redirect, anything. Auto-redemption would then bind that login to the
issuer's organization silently and irreversibly, and the CSRF token is no
defense because the page reads it from its own DOM. A confirmation step makes
the request a deliberate act by the person, and it is what puts the account
they are about to commit in front of them first.

result, so a reload cannot re-POST it.

These are exactly the states in which the invitation can never work again:
it was redeemed, or it is dead. The states that are **not** here —
mismatched address, unverified email, already in an organization, service
unavailable — did not consume the token and are fixable by the person (sign
in as the invited address, verify the mailbox, use a separate login, wait),
so the browser keeps the token and a reload retries. Dropping it there would
force them to dig the original link out of their email for a problem they
had just been told how to fix.

On a deployment with ``frames.invitations.require_verified_email`` off, the

verification is not required: it is reached there because no address was
readable, not because one was unverified. Every other heading is true either
way.

deliberate act with its own name rather than something a paragraph entry can do
by accident -- and held to the same no-duplication rule by the tests, so an
entry restating the strict heading fails instead of freezing relaxed
deployments on wording a later edit moved past."""
