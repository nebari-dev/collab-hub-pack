"""The Privacy Statement (#95): the canonical, linkable copy.

Served anonymously at :data:`~.surface.PRIVACY_PATH`, for the reasons given
in :mod:`.terms_of_service` — chiefly that its audience has not accepted yet
and so cannot sign in to read it.

Its relationship to the data statement
--------------------------------------
:mod:`.data_statement` is **not** superseded by this document and is not
folded into it. The two answer different questions for different audiences:
the data statement is the short paragraph an invitee reads next to the accept
button, deliberately one screen and deliberately unchanged since the team
authored it; this is the full statement a person can go and read. They are
cross-linked, and the data statement's contact address is the one this
document quotes, so the short form and the long form name the same address.

The copy below is a **placeholder** — see :mod:`.terms_of_service` for what
replacing it involves, and :mod:`.legal_documents` for why this file's git
history is half of the acceptance record.

"Your choices" carries a live commitment rather than a placeholder promise on
purpose. Every other section can honestly say "this will describe…", because
nothing is lost by describing it later — but a person reading a privacy
statement to find out how to get their data deleted must not be told to come
back when the lawyers are done. The address is the same one
:mod:`.data_statement` already publishes, and that route already works.
