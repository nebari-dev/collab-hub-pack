"""Shared form handling for the surface's server-rendered management pages.

Lifted out of ``routers.admin`` when the owner invitation page (#142) became
the second page with the same POST shape: an urlencoded form, read under a
byte cap, with the CSRF comparison run as a predicate so a refusal can be
answered with the page itself. The byte-counting primitives were already
shared (:mod:`.request_limits`, extracted for the same reason one page
earlier); this module is the parsing-and-checking layer above them, moved
here before a second copy could drift from the first.

Everything here keeps the properties ``routers.admin`` argued for, and that
module's docstring remains the long-form argument:

* the body is refused above the cap **by counting what arrives**, never from
  ``Content-Length`` alone;
* ``request.form()`` is never called — the urlencoded fields are parsed from
  the already-bounded bytes, so Starlette's unbounded form parse is not on
  any path through this module;
* a refusal issued before the body was read must close the connection
  (:func:`~.request_limits.connection_close_headers`), and
  :class:`FormRefused` exists so no refusal can be added that forgets it.
