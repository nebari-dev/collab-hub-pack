"""The onboarding email sent with an invitation (#155, #93).

Everything the message needs is known the moment an invitation is minted — the
link, the invited address and the expiry — so the server renders the whole
email and sends it. Nobody composes anything.

It was written for the other order: while delivery was manual (#116) the
invitation pages rendered this text for an operator to paste, with two slots
left visible for them to complete. Delivery is automated now, that display is
deleted, and the same copy is what goes out — which was the point of writing it
this way.

**The copy names no sender.** It is first person plural, signed by the team,
and it points the reader at a support address rather than asking them to reply.
That is not only tone: it is what let one text serve both delivery modes. A
message signed by whoever happened to be signed in, asking for a reply, works
from a human mailbox and breaks the moment the server sends the same words from
an unattended one. So this renderer deliberately does **not** take the session
identity — there is nothing per-operator in the output at all.

**The copy lives in ``onboarding_email.txt``, beside this module, and nowhere
else.** To change what invitees are told, edit that file: it is the text, not
a copy of the text. This module only substitutes the parts that vary per
invitation, and `docs/invitation-onboarding-email.md` explains *why* the copy
says what it says without restating it.

Placeholders are ``[UPPER CASE IN BRACKETS]``, uniformly, and substitution is
plain string replacement — no ``format`` or ``$`` templating, so a brace or a
dollar sign appearing in the copy one day cannot turn into a rendering error
in an email somebody is waiting on.

Two of them cannot be derived from the invitation at all:
:data:`NAME_PLACEHOLDER`, since an invitation records an address rather than a
person, and :data:`APP_INSTRUCTIONS_PLACEHOLDER`, which comes from deployment
configuration. :func:`render_onboarding_email` leaves them standing when they
are not supplied, and a test asserts they are the *only* ones that can survive;
:func:`render_for_automated_delivery` — the only path that sends — supplies
both and then **refuses** a body with any placeholder left in it.

**The temporary step is gone, and this note is its receipt.** The copy used to
carry a step explaining that no verification mail was coming and that an
operator would confirm the address by hand. That was true only while the realm
had no SMTP; it lands `verifyEmail=true` as of 2026-08-18
(an internal issue, #77), so the step was deleted along with
the "write to us as soon as you've finished step 2" clause in the opening.
Leaving it would have told people to ignore a verification email that had in
fact arrived. `docs/invitation-onboarding-email.md` records the same change.

reintroduce exactly that, with 90% shared text and no mechanism keeping the
shared part shared. So the variants live together, and what varies is marked.

**Why not variant strings in Python.** The subject line is read out of the
template file specifically so *all* of the copy lives in one reviewable place.
Moving a paragraph into a Python literal would undo that for the one paragraph
whose wording is most likely to be argued about.

The marker spellings deliberately match the ``[UPPER CASE IN BRACKETS]``
placeholder convention, which means :data:`UNRESOLVED_PLACEHOLDER` matches them
