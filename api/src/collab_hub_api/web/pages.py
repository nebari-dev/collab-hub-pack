"""Shared page scaffolding for the browser surface.

This is a dedicated operational surface, not a product frontend: server-
rendered HTML, one stylesheet served as its own route, and **no JavaScript at
all** — every page works as plain documents and forms, so the CSP can forbid
script outright (``script-src`` is absent and ``default-src 'none'``). The
future pages (#90–#92) compose their bodies with :func:`render_page` and
inherit the layout, headers, and CSRF form field without re-deciding any of
this.

Every dynamic value is escaped with :func:`html.escape` at the point it is
interpolated. Pages of this surface handle no invitation secrets — the
acceptance page's fragment-only token handling is its own issue — but the
headers already establish what it needs: ``Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`` on
every response, ``Cache-Control: no-store``, ``X-Frame-Options: DENY`` and a
``frame-ancestors 'none'`` CSP against clickjacked admin forms.

    (issue #86) — any unmatched ``/web/*`` path all produced responses that
    the route handlers never touched, and so answered without
    ``Referrer-Policy``, without ``no-store``, and without a CSP.

    Running as middleware makes the claim structural: the headers follow the

    carries them. Added outermost in ``make_app`` so it also covers the
