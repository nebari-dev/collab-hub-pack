"""Shared rendering for the canonical legal documents (#95).

Two documents are served from this surface as their own anonymous pages —
the Terms of Service (:mod:`.terms_of_service`) and the Privacy Statement
(:mod:`.privacy_statement`). These are the **canonical, linkable** copies.
The deployment's Keycloak terms-acceptance step shows a one-sentence consent
line that links here, so the documents can change independently from the
acceptance flow.

Why the presentation is shared and the copy is not
--------------------------------------------------
Each document's text lives in its own module, so a commit that changes the
Terms touches the Terms and nothing else. See
:data:`~.terms_of_service.TERMS_OF_SERVICE_TEXT`.
To keep the terms and privacy statement from drifting, the banner, the
effective-date line, and the cross-links are rendered here, once, for both.

Why an effective date is part of the record
-------------------------------------------
Acceptance is recorded by Keycloak as a bare ``terms_and_conditions`` user
attribute holding an epoch timestamp. This is a single acceptance for both
without document versions (openteams-ai/collab.openteams.app#111). A
timestamp only means something if you can say what the documents said at that
moment. Two things make that possible, and both are obligations on whoever
edits the copy:

* this file's siblings are edited in commits that change the copy and
  nothing else, so ``git log`` answers "what were people shown, and when?";
* every document renders :data:`EFFECTIVE_DATE_LABEL` with its own
  ``LAST_UPDATED`` constant, so the correlation can be made from the page
  itself rather than from repository archaeology.

**Bump the document's ``LAST_UPDATED`` in the same commit that changes its
text.** A date that silently lags the copy is worse than no date, because it
asserts a correlation that is false.
