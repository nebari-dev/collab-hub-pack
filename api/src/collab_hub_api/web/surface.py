place *before* the pages arrive, or its first real test is the one it fails.
An unregistered prefix costs nothing.

``/invite`` (#90) is listed and its **page path is exempted in**
:data:`PUBLIC_WEB_PATHS` — not left off this tuple. The distinction matters
and an earlier draft of this docstring had it wrong. Being off the tuple does
not make a path anonymous in a reviewed way; it makes it *invisible* to the
guard **and** to :class:`~.pages.WebSecurityHeadersMiddleware`, so the
acceptance page would have shipped without ``Referrer-Policy: no-referrer``,
without ``no-store``, and without a CSP — on the one page in the system that
handles a live invitation secret. Listing the prefix and naming the single
public path is the arrangement where the exemption is one reviewed line and
everything else under ``/invite`` is still guarded: notably
``/invite/accept/redeem``, which requires a session.

Listing a prefix before its pages exist has one consequence worth writing
down rather than leaving for the next reader to re-derive. The protection map
must leave these prefixes public (see
:func:`enforce_web_surface_preconditions`), so while ``/admin`` and ``/org``
carry no routes, a request to one of them matches nothing in this app and
falls through to the MCP catch-all mounted at ``/`` (issue #86). That is fine,
and specifically it is not an authentication hole: that mount runs its own
``McpAuthMiddleware``, which authenticates the request on the API axis before
the sub-application sees it. Map-public means "the *web* surface's own session
flow decides this path", never "unauthenticated".

"""Paths whose state-changing methods check CSRF **inside the handler**.

Every ``POST`` *this* issue ships (``/web/signout``) carries
``Depends(require_csrf)``, which is the arrangement
:func:`~.authz.route_offence` can see and therefore the one to prefer. The set
exists because "prefer" is not "require", and two of the pages built on this
surface have a real reason not to use the dependency.

``/invite/accept/redeem`` (#90) is listed **here rather than in #90**, and the
ordering is the reason: #90 is approved and on the release path, this change
is not, so the two must not each carry half of a constraint that only holds
when both are present. Merging them as written — an empty set here against a
route there that omits the dependency — makes the API refuse to start. Landing
#90 first and carrying the entry here puts the whole reconciliation on the
change that introduced the check.

That route calls ``require_csrf`` by hand, and the reason has changed once.
Originally the ordering was the size defense: the dependency's form fallback
was ``request.form()``, an unbounded read, and the route's content-type gate
had to provably run first to make it unreachable — relying on FastAPI's
dependency-solving order for that would be trusting the arrangement of a
structure rather than the code that runs. #119 bounded the fallback inside
``require_csrf`` itself (it reads through ``web.forms`` under
``MAX_FORM_BYTES``), so that constraint has relaxed: a future route may take
the dependency without arranging anything first. What keeps the redeem
route's call in-route now is its contract, not its safety — it answers a CSRF
refusal in JSON by catching ``WebForbidden``, where the declared dependency
would answer with the surface's HTML 403 page that its script cannot parse.

#91's ``/admin/invitations`` and ``/admin/invitations/revoke`` are here too,
and they are the entries that changed their mind. Both are ``@router.post``
handlers calling ``_csrf_ok()``, which runs
:func:`~.session.csrf_token_matches` — the same constant-time comparison
against the same secret — as a **predicate**, because they answer a refusal by
re-rendering their own page rather than the surface's fixed 403. A dependency
walk cannot see that any more than it can see the redeem route's call.

The earlier reading left them to #91, on the rule that an exemption for a
route nobody can point at is a claim that cannot be checked. That rule is
sound and loses to a better one here: getting this count wrong costs a
**second broken build** rather than a wrong answer, because the check and the
routes land in different changes. Carrying all three removes the coordination
dependency on #91 remembering, and it is the same argument that put ``/admin``
in the chart's default protection map. The entries are inert until those
routes mount — :func:`~.authz.stale_csrf_exemptions` judges only paths that
are actually mounted, precisely so an entry may lead its route.

Both patterns are defensible; neither is visible to a dependency-tree walk,
and none can be made visible — an endpoint that calls the comparison is
indistinguishable from one that does not without reading its body, and reading
a body for a *name* is the label-not-structure mistake this module exists to
avoid. So the choice is between a check that refuses correct code and a check
with a reviewed exemption list, and this is the second one. An entry here is a
claim that the route enforces CSRF by other means, exactly as reviewable as
:data:`PUBLIC_WEB_PATHS` — one line, in a diff, with a name attached.

    The check :func:`enforce_web_surface_preconditions` cannot make, because
    at config-parse time no routes exist yet. It runs from ``make_app`` once
    every router is mounted, and again from the lifespan for anything
    registered after that — the same two moments, and the same reasoning, as
    :func:`~.authz.verify_web_route_protection`.

    The failure it removes is a genuinely confusing one, and it is a *pair* of
    controls disagreeing rather than either being wrong. ``PathProtectionMiddleware``
    is added first in ``make_app`` and therefore runs **innermost**, after
    :class:`~.guard.WebSessionGuardMiddleware`. So on a hardened map a page at
    an unlisted prefix passes the web-session guard — the person is signed in,
    the guard is satisfied — and is then refused by the API credential check,
    which a browser holding a web session cookie cannot possibly satisfy. Two
    correct components, one unreachable page, and nothing in either component's
    logs saying the map was the problem.

    Deriving the paths from the registered routes is the point. The tuple in
    :func:`enforce_web_surface_preconditions` covered the six ``/web`` paths
    while :data:`WEB_SURFACE_PREFIXES` already promised three prefixes, so the
    documented map and the enforced one could drift for ``/admin`` and
    ``/org`` — the one thing that check exists to prevent. A route table
    cannot drift from itself.

    It also means a prefix with **no** routes requires nothing of the map,
    which is the right answer and not merely the convenient one: demanding
    that a deployment open ``/org`` before anything serves ``/org`` would be
    asking operators to widen a map for paths that do not exist.
