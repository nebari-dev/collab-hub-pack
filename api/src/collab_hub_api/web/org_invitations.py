"""The owner invitation page (issue #142): copy and markup.

``/web/org/invitations`` — restricted to the caller's own organization's
``role = 'owner'``. It does three things and deliberately not a fourth: it
takes an email address and issues an invitation **into the caller's
organization**, it shows that organization's invitations with their state,
and it revokes one. No member management, no member removal, no org
deletion; the page is the owner half of the invitation lifecycle exactly,
and a page module is where extra capability arrives unnoticed.

The one addition since #142 is bounded to that lifecycle: the **first-invite
naming step** (#92's criterion 4, observed missing on the live hub as #188).
Every organization starts with the neutral placeholder name, and an
invitation issued from here words that name into the invitee's email — so
while the placeholder stands the page shows a naming form *instead of* the
issue form, and the server refuses to issue (a well-formed submission gets a
409 before the issue action; a malformed one fails its usual check first).
Naming happens once; after it the form is gone. Changing a chosen name is a
different action for a different surface, and this page does not offer it.

**The organization is never a form field.** It is implied by the caller's
ownership, resolved server-side per request (:mod:`.owner`) — the same
wrapper rule the ``/v1/orgs/{org_id}/invitations`` routes enforce, where an
owner naming somebody else's organization is refused before the handler
exists. A page with an org field would be a second, unguarded spelling of the
target.

Two delivery modes, one page
----------------------------
Issuing hands the freshly minted secret to the delivery adapter, exactly as
#89's API route does, and the page reports the sanitized outcome (sent /
could not be sent / unconfirmed). One single-use secret travels one route,
never two, so no link is rendered here at all.

Until invitation mail was deliverable this page had a second mode that
rendered the redemption link for an operator to send by hand, reusing
``web/invite_link.py`` at that module's dated width. That module and this
page's link branch are gone (an internal issue completed),
and a deployment with no provider now gets the "could not be sent" notice
rather than a rendered credential — which is the correct answer once mail is
the delivery channel. ``email_configured`` survives only to warn the owner
*before* they issue, since without a provider every issue will fail that way.

No JavaScript, and the POSTs render rather than redirect, for the reasons
:mod:`.admin` documents: the delivery outcome exists for exactly one
response, and the issuance rule behind it — one live invitation per address,
enforced in the service under an advisory lock — is what makes an accidental
resubmit harmless.
