"""OIDC authorization-code flow against the deployment's confidential web client.

The desktop app signs in with PKCE as the public ``apollo-desktop`` client and
holds bearer tokens; a server-rendered page must not hand tokens to a browser,
so the web surface runs the code flow itself with its own **confidential**
client (``collab-web`` or similar) in the same realm, exchanges the code
server-side with the client secret, verifies the resulting ID token, and then
issues its own session cookie (``web.session``). PKCE is used *in addition to*
the client secret — it costs one hash and removes the authorization-code
injection class entirely.

Audience verification is not optional and is never inherited (issue #83's
lesson, restated as a rule): the ID token's ``aud`` must contain **this**
client's id, and when the token names an authorizing party it must be this
client too. A validly signed same-realm token minted for another client —
notably a desktop token, which shares issuer and keys — must never mint a web
session. ``verify_id_token`` therefore has no "no audience configured" path at
all: the audience argument is the client id, which is the switch that enables
the whole surface.

      JWT that happens to carry our audience from minting a session.
