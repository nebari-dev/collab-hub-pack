"""Page-facing authentication and authorization dependencies.

The web session asserts *identity only*; every authorization decision here is
resolved from the server's own stores on the request being authorized. That
split is what makes the stateless session cookie acceptable: revoking a role
locks its holder out on their next request, however long their session cookie
has left to live.

Failure shapes are page-shaped, not API-shaped. A missing or expired session
on a page is not an error to a person — it is "sign in first", so
:class:`WebAuthRequired` becomes a 303 to the sign-in route carrying the page
they were after. A role refusal is a real answer and renders the 403 page.
Neither subclasses ``HTTPException``: these must reach the handlers that
``routers.web.register_exception_handlers`` installs, not any of the generic
HTTP-exception machinery.

    Three different jobs, and they are not equally load-bearing.

    ``Mount`` and ``WebSocketRoute`` are **refused for real**: a mount's
    routing is opaque, and a WebSocket is outside the session model entirely
    (see :mod:`.guard`). Startup refusal is the enforcement for these.

    The **session** arm is a *lint*. Since
    :class:`~.guard.WebSessionGuardMiddleware` authenticates by path before
    any route runs, a page missing ``require_web_session`` is authenticated
    regardless; reporting it is a developer-experience service — the handler
    will not receive its typed session — not a gate. That is precisely why
    this may compare structure at all: fooling it gains an attacker nothing.

    The **CSRF** arm is *enforcement*, and it is here because nothing else
    does it. The guard inversion made a forgotten ``require_web_session``
    harmless; it did nothing for a forgotten ``require_csrf``, which stayed
    exactly as silent as it ever was — a page of #90–#92 adding a ``POST``
    and omitting the dependency was unprotected with nothing at startup
    noticing. ``SameSite=Lax`` bounds that but does not close it: the
    registrable domain is ``openteams.app``, so a request from any sibling
    subdomain is *same-site* and carries the cookie. ``__Host-`` prevents
    cookie **planting**, not cookie **sending**.

    This is enforcement against *forgetting*, not against an adversary — only
    someone who can register routes can trip it, and they could equally write
    a handler that ignores the token. That is why an in-route check is an
    acceptable answer, declared in
    :data:`~.surface.CSRF_ENFORCED_IN_ROUTE` and reviewed once, rather than
    something this function tries to detect. It cannot detect it: an
    endpoint that calls the check itself, or reimplements the same
    constant-time comparison, is indistinguishable from one that does neither
    without reading its body — and reading a body for a name is the
    label-not-structure mistake this module exists to avoid.

    The type test is an ``isinstance`` against the real
    :class:`fastapi.routing.APIRoute`, not a duck-typed ``.dependant``. A
    fabricated object carrying an invented dependency tree passed the old
    check; the documented rule was always "APIRoute only", and now the code

    mounted, and each is reported here.

    Judged **per path**, over every route registered at it, because the
    registry is keyed by path and one path may be several routes — a page that
    serves its form on ``GET`` and takes the submission on ``POST`` is two
    ``APIRoute`` objects sharing a path, and judging them separately reported
    the ``GET`` as needing no exemption while the ``POST`` quietly relied on
    one:

    * the route is not on the browser surface at all, so the exemption was
      never doing anything;
    * **no** route at that path answers a state-changing method, so there was
      nothing to exempt;
    * **every** state-changing route at that path already carries
      ``require_csrf`` as a dependency, so the exemption is now redundant — the interesting case, because a route that
      *gains* the dependency leaves behind an entry claiming an in-route check
      that is no longer there, and the registry stops describing reality
      without anything failing.

    Only paths that are **actually mounted** are judged. An entry naming a
    path with no route is left alone, and that is a decision rather than an
    omission: :func:`~..core.make_app` mounts the operator router only when
    ``org_source_is_membership()``, so on a claims-sourced deployment #91's
    ``/admin`` routes are legitimately absent while its entries are correctly
    present. Failing on absence would refuse to start every claims-mode
    deployment. It would also refuse a repository mid-stack, where an entry
    lands one PR ahead of its route — which is exactly the arrangement this
    branch is in.

    That does leave a typo inert, and it is worth being clear that the cost is
    tidiness rather than safety: a misspelled entry does not exempt anything,
    so the route it was meant to cover is still caught by
    :func:`route_offence` and still fails the rollout, loudly, naming the real

    **This is a rollout gate, not a runtime control**, and the distinction is

    It runs twice — once in ``make_app`` when every router it mounts is
    registered, once in the lifespan for anything a caller added afterwards —
    and then never again. A route registered after the server starts
    accepting traffic is never seen by it. So for CSRF, whose only other
    enforcement is the per-route dependency this walks for, a post-boot
    registration with no token check is genuinely unprotected and nothing here
    will say so.

    That gap is accepted rather than closed, and the reasoning is the same one
    that decided the session guard the other way. The session check became
    request-time (:class:`~.guard.WebSessionGuardMiddleware`) because route
    *structure* was being trusted as an authentication boundary and structure
    is authored by exactly the person the boundary defends against. CSRF is
    not that shape: the attacker is a cross-origin page, and a cross-origin
    page cannot register a route. The only actor who can is code already
    running in this process, and a route added post-boot is not a deployment
    path — ``make_app`` registers everything a pod serves before the lifespan
    opens.

    A request-time CSRF middleware would close it, and was considered. It
    would re-derive on every mutating request what the dependency already
    decided, to defend against a caller who by construction can do worse
    things than skip a token. That is cost with no attacker on the other side
    of it.

    So: what is enforced at runtime is the session (the guard) and CSRF (the
    route's own ``require_csrf``, or its declared in-route equivalent). What
    is enforced at rollout is that those are *present*. Do not read a passing

    The token is read from the ``X-CSRF-Token`` header or the ``csrf_token``
    form field (the pattern the layout's forms use), and compared in constant
    time against the secret inside the signed, HttpOnly session cookie.
    SameSite=Lax already keeps cross-site POSTs from carrying the cookie at
    all; the token is the defense that does not depend on cookie semantics.

    The form fallback is **bounded** (issue #119). It used to be
    ``request.form()``, which buffers the body to completion with no cap of
    its own — so any route that relied on this dependency could be made to
    buffer an arbitrarily large body by an authenticated caller, and #90's
    redemption endpoint had to gate its content type *before* the check to
    make the branch unreachable. The read now goes through
    :func:`~.forms.form_fields`: the body is refused above
    :data:`~.forms.MAX_FORM_BYTES` by **counting what arrives** (never from
    ``Content-Length``, which a chunked request does not carry), and
    ``multipart/form-data`` is refused outright rather than parsed — its
    parsing cost is not bounded by the byte count alone, and no form of this
    surface submits multipart. Every caller inherits the bound; no route has
    to make the fallback unreachable to be safe from it.

    The failure shapes are deliberately distinct. A refused *body* — oversize,
    or a form shape the surface does not read — raises
    :class:`~.forms.FormRefused` before the body is consumed, which
    ``routers.web.register_exception_handlers`` answers with the carried
    status (413/415) and ``Connection: close`` (see
    :mod:`.request_limits` for why a refusal issued before the read must
    close). A missing or wrong *token* — including a body of some other
    content type presenting no header, which this fallback never reads —
    stays :class:`WebForbidden` and the surface's 403 page: not being too
    large does not make a request authorized, and being too large says
