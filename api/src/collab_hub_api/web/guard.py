"""The browser surface's security boundary: the guard authenticates, itself.

Three rounds of review taught this module its shape, and the lesson is worth
stating because it is easy to re-learn the hard way. The guard used to *prove*
that each route enforced a session, by inspecting the route's structure — its
type, its dependency tree, the identity of the callables in it. Every round,
that inspection was defeated by forging whatever it inspected: an
``APIRouter`` registered outside the construction path, a ``Mount`` hiding a
child app, a ``WebSocketRoute`` that HTTP middleware never sees, a dependency
wearing ``@wraps(require_web_session)`` while enforcing nothing, a duck-typed
object with a fabricated ``dependant``.

That game does not converge. The marker being inspected is written by exactly
the person the guard protects against — a future page author who does the
wrong thing — so each fix only moves the forgery one level down.

So the boundary is inverted. **This middleware validates the session cookie
itself**, for every request under a guarded prefix that is not explicitly
public, before the request reaches any route. It consults no route, no
dependency, and no marker. A page that forgets its dependency is therefore
authenticated anyway; a forged marker buys nothing, because nothing on the
request path reads one.

What the pieces are now:

* **This middleware — the control.** Path in, session out. Raw ASGI, because
  ``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` is never invoked for ``websocket`` scopes and a
  socket under a guarded prefix must still be refused.
* **``require_web_session`` — a convenience.** It still runs at the route and
  still gives handlers a typed :class:`~.session.WebSession`, but it is no
  longer what stands between an anonymous caller and a page.
* **``verify_web_route_protection`` — a lint.** It still shouts at startup
  about routes missing the dependency, because a missing dependency is a bug
  worth fixing. Its failure can no longer mean anonymous access, so there is
  nothing to gain by fooling it.

The startup refusals for ``Mount`` and ``WebSocketRoute`` stay real refusals:
a mounted sub-app's own paths *are* covered by this middleware, but its
routing is opaque, and sockets are outside the model entirely.

``Connection: close`` is the addition, and it is here rather than in

surface actually serves has consumed its request and should keep its
connection.

The guard answers before routing and never touches the request body — for
every refusal, in every shape. Answering an HTTP/1.1 request whose body has
not reached end-of-message leaves the server working through what the client
is still sending before it can begin the next cycle, so the connection is held.
That was measured at about ten seconds against uvicorn on the acceptance
page's own redemption endpoint, and it is the same here, one layer earlier:
an unauthenticated ``POST /invite/accept/redeem`` carrying a body is refused
by this middleware and never reaches the handler that closes.

Unconditional rather than keyed on the method, deliberately. The invariant
that makes it correct — "this code never consumes a body" — is a property of
the middleware and holds for every request it sees, while "does this method
have a body" is a second thing to get right, on attacker-supplied input, for
no measurable gain: the cost of closing is one connection setup on a refusal,
and refusals are not the hot path.
