"""The Terms of Service (#95): the canonical, linkable copy.

Served anonymously at :data:`~.surface.TERMS_PATH`, for the same reason the
data statement is (:mod:`.data_statement`) and then one more: the audience
includes people who have not accepted yet and therefore cannot sign in. A
document you must already have agreed to in order to read is not a document
anyone agreed to.

The copy below is a **placeholder**. It is structured the way the finished
agreement will be, and each section says what it will contain, so the
acceptance flow can be wired end to end before counsel has written a word.
Replacing it is one commit: rewrite :data:`TERMS_OF_SERVICE_TEXT`, bump
:data:`TERMS_OF_SERVICE_LAST_UPDATED`, and clear
:data:`TERMS_OF_SERVICE_IS_PLACEHOLDER`.

This file's git history is half of the acceptance record — Keycloak stores
only a timestamp, with no document version — so an edit here should change
the copy and nothing else in the same commit. :mod:`.legal_documents` carries
the full argument.
