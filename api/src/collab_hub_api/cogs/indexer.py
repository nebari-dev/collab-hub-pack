"""Reconciliation indexer: how Cogs get from a registry into the catalog (issue #84).

One sweep, per configured source:

1. enumerate repositories and artifacts through the source adapter;
2. skip digests already in the catalog with the same tag set; a changed tag
   set (or a digest that was marked removed and is back) is written without
   refetching anything;
3. for a new digest fetch the manifest, select ``COG.md`` and the profile
   file it names, read the card, and insert. A manifest with no ``COG.md``
   is recorded as *non-Cog* with a reason so a repository full of images is
   not re-read every cycle;
4. mark this source's rows whose digest is no longer present as
   ``removed_at = now()`` -- never delete;
5. record per-artifact failures in ``read_errors`` and carry on; log a
   summary and export it as metrics.

Three things keep a sweep from doing damage:

- **Single flight, by deployment shape; the lock is a belt.** The chart
  runs the indexer as its own one-replica workload with a ``Recreate``
  strategy (issue #148), so on a healthy release there is never a second
  sweeper -- not across API replicas, not across a rollout. Under that sits
  the store's sweep lock (a session-level Postgres advisory lock), which
  catches what the shape cannot: an operator running two indexer releases
  against one database. The loser logs and waits for the next interval. The
  lock hands the winner a connection-bound *view* of the store; every read
  and write of the sweep goes through it and so rides the lock's own session
  (issue #128), which is what makes cancellation simple. Every store call
  of a sweep -- the acquisition, the view's reads and writes, the release --
  runs on one thread of the sweep's own, in submission order, so a
  cancelled sweep queues its release behind whatever call is still in
  flight and moves on without waiting: the release runs the moment that
  call returns, or, when the pod goes first, the session dies and the
  server drops the lock and the in-flight write together. No draining, no
  deadlines, nothing handed to a second thread: what a cancellation leaves
  behind is one running call, its queued release, and nothing else.
- **Removal needs a complete picture.** Rows are only marked removed for a
  source whose enumeration fully succeeded this sweep. A registry that
  answers ``list_repositories`` with an error, one repository's listing that
  fails, or an enumeration past the per-source bound leaves that source's
  removal step skipped -- a transient outage must not mark a whole catalog
  gone. The adapters uphold their half: past their own limits they *raise*
  rather than silently truncate, because a truncated list presented as
  complete is exactly what turns a bound into false removals.
- **One artifact cannot poison the sweep.** The whole per-artifact read
  is guarded (any exception, not just the OCI hierarchy -- a client bug must
  cost one row, not the sweep), and a card Postgres cannot store (NUL in a
  string, or oversized) is recorded as ``failed`` with a reason instead of
  aborting. Database *outages* still abort the sweep on purpose: retrying
  per artifact against a dead database would spend the whole budget learning
  the same fact.

**What is and is not kept out of storage and logs.** Cards are the published
bundle's own content, stored verbatim -- that is the contract (parent issue
acceptance: the reader's output, structure preserved), so anything a
publisher writes into ``COG.md`` or the profile lands in the catalog as-is.
The guarantee this module makes is narrower and absolute: *configured
registry credentials* never reach cards, ``read_errors``, or logs.
``read_errors`` and log lines therefore carry exception class names -- plus
the message only for the OCI hierarchy, whose contract is that messages name
neither URLs nor headers -- never raw URLs, tokens, or exception chains.

Fairness under bounds: enumeration is complete (or the source is marked
failed), while *fetching* is budgeted per sweep. Already-known digests cost
nothing, so successive sweeps walk past what earlier sweeps indexed and the
tail of a large registry is reached instead of starved; deferred artifacts
are still part of the present set, so removal stays correct.

Targeted entry points for the webhook receiver (#86): :meth:`CogIndexer.reindex`
for one ``(source_id, repository, digest)`` and :meth:`CogIndexer.mark_removed`
for a delete. Neither takes the sweep lock -- both are idempotent single-row
writes, and a sweep running at the same time converges to the same state.
Neither can ride a running sweep's lock session either: they write through
the store itself, whose methods take their own pooled connections and never
consult the lock (issue #148), so they land concurrently with a sweep.
