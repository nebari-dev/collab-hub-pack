"""Publishing through the Hub (issue #180): pushes written through to one source.

The ``/v2/`` router speaks the push half of the OCI Distribution API; this
module is what stands behind it. A push is accepted from a client that holds
nothing but a Hub sign-in, checked, and written to the one registry source
marked ``publish: true`` with the Hub's own credential for that source.

**Who may push.** Three things, all checked on *every* push request and
before a byte is forwarded (:meth:`CogPublisher.authorize`):

1. the caller holds the **publish permission** (:class:`PublishPolicy`): a
   role or a user id the deployment's configuration names. Nobody by
   default, and being able to pull never implies it;
2. the repository is one the caller's **organization owns**, or a new one. A
   repository belongs to the organization that first publishes to it
   through the Hub, from *before* its first manifest is forwarded (see
   below); later pushes need membership of that organization. A platform
   operator may push to any that is settled;
3. a repository the catalog already knows but that was **not** published
   through the Hub (it has no owner record) accepts pushes from platform
   operators only.

**Uploads** are sessions (:mod:`.publish_store`): the client sees the Hub's
own session id, the backing registry's session URL stays in the database,
and bytes are streamed through -- counted against ``max_blob_bytes``, never
buffered. The backing registry verifies each blob against its digest when
the upload is closed. Three rules keep the two sides in step:

- the Hub's slot is taken **before** the registry is asked to open its
  session, so the per-user cap holds before anything exists upstream, and
  is held by its opener until the registry's session is attached to it;
- a session the Hub lets go of -- past the cap, expired, cancelled, dead --
  is cancelled at the registry **before** its record is deleted, a few per
  request, and a record whose cancellation failed is kept until it succeeds;
- one request at a time may write to a session: each takes the session's
  **lease** before it forwards anything, and gives it back only when it
  knows what the registry took. After any write whose outcome is not known
  -- a timeout, a lost response, a failure to record it -- the session is
  **retired**: the Hub's byte count can no longer be trusted, so the client
  is told the upload is unknown and starts again.

**A manifest is validated before it is committed**
(:meth:`CogPublisher.put_manifest`). The blobs it names were just uploaded,
so the Hub reads the bundle with the catalog's own reader, through the
indexer's code path, *before* forwarding the manifest. A bundle the catalog
would not list -- not a Cog, no id, or a reader error -- is refused with the
reader's errors, nothing is written to the registry and nothing is listed.

**The name is its publisher's organization's before the manifest is
forwarded, and nothing is listed until the registry has accepted it.** The
Hub first writes the repository's row, *pending* and owned by the
publisher's organization, and a record of the attempt. The registry's
answer then decides: on acceptance the row is committed, the attempt is
marked accepted and the catalog row is written; on a definite refusal the
attempt is dropped and, if it was the organization's last one in flight,
so is the pending row. When the outcome is unknown nothing is withdrawn:
the registry may hold the manifest, so the name stays that organization's
-- no other organization can take it, only the same one can try again, and
after a grace period sweeps look there and settle it if they find content.
Only an attempt known to be accepted ever says who published a digest.

**An accepted manifest is indexed in the request**: the row the validation
produced is stored through the indexer's lock-less targeted path, in one
transaction with its tag assignment and the authenticated publisher (Hub
user and organization), under the request's own deadline. If that write
fails, the answer says so -- the manifest is stored, and not listed -- rather
than reporting a publish that the catalog does not show. A later sweep
reconciles the row like any other and leaves the publisher alone.

Failures are :class:`PublishError` subclasses whose messages are written for
the client and name no backing host, URL or credential.
