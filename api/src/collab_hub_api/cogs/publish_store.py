"""Repository ownership and upload sessions for publishing through the Hub (issue #180).

Two small relations, both created by migration 14 of
:mod:`..frames.collab_schema` and never by this module:

- ``collab_cog_repositories`` -- **who owns a repository published through
  the Hub**. One row per repository path, written *before* the first
  manifest for it is forwarded to the registry, as ``pending`` and already
  belonging to the publisher's organization; it becomes ``committed`` once
  the registry has accepted a manifest. A pending row is deleted only when
  the registry has **definitely refused** every manifest that organization
  had in flight for it (the row counts them). An unknown outcome leaves it
  pending and owned: the registry may hold the manifest, so the name is
  never handed to another organization automatically. Only the same
  organization can publish to a pending name; a platform operator can
  release one that is stuck (``docs/cog-registry.md``). Committed rows
  extend the publish source's enumeration, and so do pending rows older than
  a short grace period, so that a sweep can find content whose commit was
  lost -- and commits the row when it does.
- ``collab_cog_upload_sessions`` -- **an upload in progress**. A client
  uploads a blob over several requests that may land on different replicas,
  so the session lives here: the Hub's own session id (the only one a client
  ever sees), who opened it, and the backing registry's session URL, which
  never leaves the Hub. The row is written *before* the registry is asked to
  open its session, and is held by its opener's *lease* until the registry's
  location is attached. Afterwards one request at a time holds the lease
  while it forwards bytes, and gives it back only when the outcome is
  recorded: a lease that lapses means nobody knows what the registry took,
  and the session is dead. A dead or expired session is kept until its
  registry session has been cancelled (see
  :meth:`PublishStore.claim_stale_uploads`).

Three backends, as for the catalog: Postgres over the shared pool, in memory
for tests and single-process development, and one that refuses. Every
Postgres call spends from the request's budget
(:func:`.deadline.bounded_connection`), like the other serving stores.
