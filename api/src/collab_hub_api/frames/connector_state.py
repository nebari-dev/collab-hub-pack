"""Which connectors are switched on, and making that switch bite.

Deployment configuration holds the credentials and therefore decides what this
hub is *capable* of. This table holds one bit per connector and decides what is
*available* right now. The split is deliberate and non-overlapping:

* the panel can never turn on a connector that has no credentials, because it
  does not hold any -- there is nothing for it to write;
* the panel can turn a configured connector off, and back on again.

So there is no second source of truth for how a connector authenticates. There
is exactly one new fact -- is it on -- and it lives in one place.

How it is enforced
------------------
:func:`apply_disabled` blanks the credential fields of a disabled connector
before the request sees the configuration, through the one dependency every
connector route already takes. A disabled connector is then indistinguishable,
downstream, from one that was never configured -- which is a state those routes
already refuse correctly. No route had to change, and no route can forget.

The alternative was a check in each of the twenty-odd connector handlers, which
is twenty-odd chances to miss one.
