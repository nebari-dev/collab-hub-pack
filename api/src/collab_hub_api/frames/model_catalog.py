"""Reading the model catalogue from the serving layer.

The catalogue is the serving pack's, and this reads it over its OpenAI-shaped
``GET /v1/models``. Nothing here writes a model into this database. That is the
whole design: a copy would drift, and a panel showing a model the gateway will
not serve (or hiding one it will) is worse than a panel that is occasionally
unavailable.

Which is why an unreachable endpoint raises rather than returning an empty
list. "This hub serves no models" and "I could not ask" are different answers,
and only one of them should make an operator start deleting things.
