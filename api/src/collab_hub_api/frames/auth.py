    Identity is still the verified token's subject (the identity pin is a
    startup precondition of this mode). Everything organizational comes from
    the server's own tables: ``(org_id, org_role)`` from the one home-org row,
    ``workspace_id`` from :data:`WORKSPACE_DEFAULT`. Any ``org_id`` or
    ``workspace_id`` claim in the token is **ignored** — the whole point is
    that a caller cannot assert their own tenancy.

    Four outcomes, deliberately distinguishable:

    * ``None`` — the token carries no acceptable identity. The caller turns
      this into a 401, exactly as on the claims path.
    * **An org-scoped context** — an active membership row: ``(org_id,
      org_role)`` from it, plus the platform role resolved in the same store
      read.
    * **A hub-scoped context** — no active membership, but an **active
      platform role** (issue #89's bootstrap: on a fresh deployment the
      operator's organization does not exist until their first invitation is
      accepted). ``home_org_id`` is ``None`` and ``org_role`` is ``None``:
      the operator is authenticated and holds platform authority, while every
      org-scoped surface fails closed through the :attr:`AuthContext.org_id`
      property. A *removed* membership grants no org context here either —
      the platform axis stands on its own, and revoking an operator means
      revoking the platform role, not their membership.
    * :class:`NoOrganizationError` — authenticated, but neither an active
      membership nor an active platform role. A removed row stays bound to
      its organization but grants nothing, so removal takes effect on the
      very next request.

    **Anything the store raises propagates untouched.** A Postgres outage
    must surface as 503 ``database_unavailable`` — never a 401 (which would
    sign every user out of a healthy deployment over a transient database
    blip) and never ``no_organization`` (the membership is *unknown*, not
    absent). This path fails closed and holds no cache; see
    :class:`~.orgs.PostgresOrgStore`.

    What removal does and does not do: dropping ``internal`` access is
    mechanical — ``internal`` frames are scoped by ``org_id``, and a removed
    caller no longer has one. An **explicit** ``readers`` grant naming that
    subject is untouched by this, because reader grants are user-scoped by
    design and are not evaluated against organization membership. Removal is
    therefore not total revocation, and must not be described as such.

    **Platform roles are the second axis, resolved here alongside membership**
    (issue #87). An organization owner has authority inside one organization; a
    deployment operator has authority across all of them, which ``org_role``
    cannot express. Both axes come back from one store read
    (:meth:`~.orgs.OrgStore.resolve_principal` — one connection, one round
    trip), so the answer is never partial: a store failure fails the whole
    request closed rather than resolving a membership whose platform role is
    unknown, which nothing downstream could tell from "not an operator".
