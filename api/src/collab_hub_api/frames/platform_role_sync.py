"""Who is an operator, decided by the identity provider and copied here.

Until now the only way to grant the operator role was a hand-written ``psql``
insert, recorded by an ``operator.manual`` audit row. That is the right
bootstrap and the wrong steady state: it puts the grant outside the system an
organization actually administers identity in, and it does not scale past the
first person.

So the identity provider owns the fact and this module keeps a copy. Keycloak
is used as a plain OIDC provider here -- nothing in this module calls its admin
API. At sign-in the verified ID token's ``groups`` claim is read and
``collab_platform_roles`` is reconciled against it.

Why a copy at all, rather than reading the claim on every request
----------------------------------------------------------------
Because authorization is resolved from this server's own stores on the request
being authorized (see :mod:`..web.authz`), which is what makes the stateless
session cookie acceptable. A claim read per request would work on the bearer
axis and not on the browser one, where the session deliberately carries
identity and nothing else. One source for both axes is worth more than the
freshness a second mechanism would buy.

The cost is stated rather than hidden: on the browser axis a revocation takes
effect at the holder's next sign-in, not their next request. Before this
module, revoking a row locked its holder out immediately. That is a real
weakening, and it is the price of the identity provider owning the fact.

``source``, and why a column was worth a migration
--------------------------------------------------
Sync must be able to *remove*. A copy that only ever adds is worse than no copy
at all: dropping someone from the admin group would leave their row standing
forever, and the deployment would believe the identity provider had revoked
them. So reconcile revokes as well as grants.

Which immediately endangers the bootstrap operator, whose row was inserted by
hand and whose subject may be in no group at all. If sync could revoke that
row, the first sign-in after this ships would lock the first admin out of the
deployment they just bootstrapped.

Hence ``source``: ``manual`` rows are administered here and never touched by
sync; ``idp`` rows are sync's own and it may grant or revoke them freely. It is
the split any OIDC group sync ends up needing, and for this reason.

Sync never revokes the **last** active operator, whatever the claim says. A
renamed admin group, or a groups mapper switched between ``/group`` and
``group``, would otherwise revoke every synced operator at their next sign-in,
and the last one out leaves psql as the only way back. The refusal is logged
(``platform_role_sync_kept_last_operator``) so the cause gets noticed. The
group name is matched with or without its leading slash for the same reason.
