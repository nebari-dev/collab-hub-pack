"""Usage-statistics storage backends.

Usage capture has two halves:

- **Seen users** — every authenticated request upserts the caller into a
  per-tenant user roster (identity, email, first/last seen). Recording is
  best-effort and throttled so the auth path never gains a per-request write.
- **Usage events** — client-reported activity the hub cannot observe itself
  (today: ``chat_created`` from the desktop app). Events are append-only rows,
  aggregated by the usage endpoints alongside the existing frame history and
  active-state tables.

Backend semantics mirror ``history.py``: usage is a relational feature that
rides the shared ``frames.postgres`` URL. ``InMemory`` exists only for
tests/dev; with no DB configured the builder returns ``UnavailableUsageStore``.
On the unavailable store, best-effort writes (``record_user_seen``) are no-ops
while event recording and all reads raise ``UsageUnavailableError`` (→ 503).
