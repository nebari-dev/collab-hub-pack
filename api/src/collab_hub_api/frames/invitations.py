"""The invitation lifecycle: issue, list, revoke, redeem (issue #89, Gate B/E).

One operator sending one signup link is the whole point of the public-hub
invitation track, and this module is where that link becomes state. It owns
three things and deliberately not a fourth:

- **The secret.** Minted here (256 random bits), hashed here, compared here.
  What is persisted is the SHA-256 hex; the raw secret appears in no column,
  no log line, no audit row, no error message, and no response body, and its
  only egress is the invited mailbox.

  Keeping it out of logs, dumps, and responses is **structural**, not a list
  of patched exits. Three rounds of review established that suppressing
  ``__repr__`` and special-casing ``model_dump`` and ``__getstate__`` only
  ever closes the routes someone remembered; ``dataclasses.asdict``,
  ``astuple``, ``vars()``, ``json.dumps(..., default=vars)`` and — decisively
  — FastAPI's own response encoder all read the **field value** and would
  hand it out regardless. So no type here stores a raw ``str`` credential:
  every carrier holds a :class:`~.credentials.InvitationSecret`, which
  redacts itself under every rendering, refuses copying, pickling, and
  mutation, carries no ``__dict__`` to flatten, cannot be subclassed, and
  serializes to a redaction under pydantic. A carrier added later inherits
  all of it by holding that type.

  The claim is deliberately narrow, and stated the narrow way here because a
  broader one is falsifiable in a line: ``.reveal()`` is the only *supported*
  accessor, so every supported escape is one greppable call, and what the
  wrapper defends against is **accidental** escape through machinery that
  walks objects generically. Code that deliberately reads the slot can still
  read it — and could equally have called ``.reveal()`` — so nothing here
  tries to stop that. See :class:`~.credentials.InvitationSecret`.

  The one frame that does hold the raw string,
  :func:`hash_invitation_secret`, cannot raise **for the inputs the accept
  route can deliver** — pydantic has already validated the value as a ``str``
  matching a strict ASCII pattern — so on that path it never appears in a
  traceback. That is a claim about the route, not a claim of totality over
  arbitrary Python values; see the function's own docstring.
- **The state machine.** ``pending``/``accepted``/``revoked`` at rest, with
  ``expired`` **derived** from ``pending`` + ``expires_at`` so no sweeper has
  to keep a fourth stored state true. Every surface presents
  :func:`effective_status`, never the bare column.
- **The acceptance transaction.** Redeeming a token creates a membership row
  — and, for an org-creating invitation, the organization too — atomically
  with consuming the token and with the audit row that records it.

What it does **not** own: authorization (the two wrappers in
:mod:`.authorization` decide who may issue and revoke what) and the audit
insert (:func:`.audit.audited` is the only writer of ``collab_audit_events``).
This module *composes* both; it re-implements neither.

One audited action per mutation, and the action names the consequential thing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
``audited()`` writes exactly one row per invocation, and a second invocation
would be a second transaction — which is precisely what the primitive exists
to prevent. So each mutation here declares one action:

- issuing → ``invitation.send``;
- revoking → ``invitation.revoke`` (a revoke that changes nothing writes no
  row at all: it is not an action);
- accepting into an **existing** organization → ``invitation.redeem``;
- accepting an org-creating invitation → ``org.create``, with the accepter as
  actor, in the same transaction that creates the organization and the
  membership — the ratified requirement.

That last case therefore produces no ``invitation.redeem`` row, which is a
real asymmetry and is stated rather than hidden: both acceptance rows carry
``detail.invitation_id``, so following one invitation end to end is a query on
that key (documented in ``docs/frames-operations.md``) rather than on the
action alone.

Address matching (Gate B, ratified 2026-08-03; amended on #157)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Acceptance requires the caller's ``email`` claim to equal the invited address
**but for ASCII case**. Gate B chose exact match over canonicalization, and that
still holds for everything except case: there is no plus-tag stripping, no
dot-folding, no provider-specific rule, and no canonical column.

Gate B's *other* half — that the caller's OIDC ``email_verified`` claim is
boolean ``true`` — is a deployment setting since #190:
``frames.invitations.require_verified_email``, default on. Where it is off, the
invitation token stands in for the proof of mailbox control and **the address
match above still applies unchanged**. This paragraph exists because the
unconditional version of it was the canonical description of Gate B, and a
reader reasoning from it would conclude a claim with ``email_verified: false``
can never reach :func:`emails_match` — and might remove the ``require_verified``
plumbing as dead code.

The original rule was byte-exact, and it was wrong for one specific reason.
**Keycloak lowercases the email on every account it holds**, so the claim it
asserts is ``alice@example.com`` however the address was typed — and an
invitation issued to ``Alice@example.com`` could therefore never be redeemed
by anyone. That was documented here as a consequence "real and accepted"; it
was neither, and it blocked a real invitee on the public hub. Preserving case
never made the check stricter, because the identity provider had already
decided case does not distinguish accounts.

So the service folds ASCII case at both ends — :func:`validate_invited_email`
stores the lowered form, :func:`emails_match` compares the lowered forms — and
folds nothing else. :func:`ascii_folded_bytes` is the single definition, and
its docstring records why the ASCII bound is a safety property rather than an
implementation detail.

A genuine mismatch is still its own terminal state with its own wire code, and
it still does **not** consume the token, so the issuer can revoke and reissue.

Two consequences of matching the *claim at accept time* rather than a
snapshot taken at issuance, both tested:

- if the login's verified email changes to something else between issuance
  and acceptance, acceptance fails with ``invitation_email_mismatch``;
- if it changes *to* the invited address, acceptance succeeds. There is no
  issuance-time snapshot to fall back to and no memory of a previous claim.

Single-issuer assumption (R12)
------------------------------
Identity is the OIDC ``sub``, and a bare ``sub`` is unique only within one
issuer. Everything below — ``created_by``, ``accepted_by``, the membership
primary key, the audit ``actor`` — is a bare ``sub``, so this whole service
is correct only for a deployment that trusts exactly one issuer. That is a
startup precondition already, enforced by
:func:`.identity.enforce_single_issuer_for_pin`, not merely a note. Supporting
a second issuer later needs an explicit account model keyed on
``(issuer, sub)``; it is not a configuration change.

Not here, and deliberately: abuse controls
------------------------------------------
There is **no cap on how many pending invitations an actor or an organization
may hold**, and no rate limit on issuance. That is a deferral, not an
oversight, and it belongs to a specific place: issue #93 (``s07``, invitation
email delivery, register R3/R6) owns "invitation-email rate limits (per-org
and per-operator)", with the acceptance criterion that they "bound both a
compromised owner account and an operator script". #93 depends on this issue,
so the ordering is intended. Two neighbouring pieces of the same deferral live
there too: durable delivery state, and re-send that rotates the secret rather
than minting a second live token.

Separately, rate limiting the *redemption* surface — the one endpoint an
unauthenticated-adjacent caller can reach — is Phase 5 abuse-control work
(``s02``), not #93's.

One live invitation per address, where the caller asks for it (issue #91)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Scope first, because the obvious reading of this is wrong.** This is a
property of *one call*, not of the deployment. Nothing here stops a second live
invitation to the same address from existing — it stops **this call** from
creating one. :meth:`PostgresInvitationService.create` still mints
unconditionally, and that is unchanged: the API surface's contract (both the
operator routes and the owner routes in ``routers.invitations``) is #89's and
this module does not rewrite it. So an address can hold two live invitations
today, if one of them came from the API.

That is deliberate for this milestone rather than an oversight. The case the
rule exists for is a human retrying an issuance on the operator page after an
ambiguous send, and unifying the two paths means changing the semantics of a
merged, shipped ``create()`` that a wire contract and the desktop are built
against. #93 owns re-send policy properly, including rotation. Anyone stating
this guarantee — in code, docs, or a release note — must state it scoped to the
page.

:meth:`PostgresInvitationService.create_unless_live` is the *opt-in* variant
#91's operator page calls: it refuses to mint while a ``pending``, unexpired
invitation for the same address exists, and returns that invitation instead.

It is a separate method rather than a flag on ``create`` because the two have
different contracts (one always returns a secret, one may return no secret at
all), and a boolean parameter would put the difference somewhere a reader of a
call site cannot see it.

The rule is enforced **inside the audited transaction**, behind a
transaction-scoped advisory lock keyed on the address. A check-then-insert in
two statements is not enough here: a row that does not exist yet cannot be
locked, so two concurrent issuances for one address would both read "none" and
both insert. The advisory lock is what serializes them, and it is why an
operator double-submitting a form gets one token rather than two — which is
exactly the case the milestone cares about, because a human retries after an
ambiguous send.

Matching folds ASCII case, like everything else about an address here since
the amendment on #157: ``Alice@example.com`` and ``alice@example.com`` are one
address, so they cannot each hold a live invitation. That falls out of
:func:`validate_invited_email` storing the lowered form — the check, the
advisory lock key, and the stored row all see the same string — rather than
from a second comparison rule. Nothing beyond case is folded, so the plus-tag
and dot spellings Gate B refused to unify are still distinct addresses.

Listings are bounded here, though, because that is a response-size and
correctness question rather than a policy one: see
:meth:`PostgresInvitationService.list_all`.

Backend
-------
Postgres only. The guarantees this module exists to provide — one org exactly
once under concurrent acceptance, a token that cannot be redeemed twice, a
mutation that commits with its audit row or not at all — are the row lock,
the primary key, and the transaction. An in-memory backend could imitate the
API and none of the guarantees, so a deployment without the shared frames
Postgres gets :class:`InvitationsUnavailableError` (503) instead of a
plausible-looking fake.

    ``default_transaction_isolation`` to REPEATABLE READ or SERIALIZABLE on the

    not: an invitee would receive a 503 where the wire contract promises

    Retrying is chosen over asserting READ COMMITTED at startup for two
    reasons. The setting is not a property of this build — it can change
    underneath a running pod, so a startup assertion would guard a fact that
    can quietly stop being true, which is the kind of guard this codebase
    treats as worse than none. And refusing to boot would turn a change that
    does not break correctness into an outage.

    Bounded, and without backoff: a serialization failure means the conflicting
    transaction has already committed or aborted, so the retry contends with
    nothing and a sleep would only add latency to a request someone is waiting
    on. Three attempts, then the error propagates as the 503 it would have
    been anyway.

    Only whole audited mutations are passed here. Each attempt re-runs its own

        immutable — enforced by a trigger in migration v3, not merely by

        Revoking an already-revoked invitation is a no-op success that writes
        **no** second audit row — a revoke that did not change anything is
        not an action, and recording it would make the log describe events
        that did not happen.

        Unaffected by the transaction-clock problem that governs acceptance:
        revoke compares no timestamps at all. It branches on the *stored*
        status and its ``UPDATE`` guards on ``status = 'pending'``, which is
        deliberate — a lapsed invitation is still revocable, and revoking one
        is exactly how an issuer retires a link whose expiry they do not want
        to wait out. There is no deadline here to be evaluated stale.

        """Redeem a token: create the membership (and maybe the organization).

        ``service_groups`` are the identity-provider groups this acceptance
        *owes* the accepter (#180). They are recorded here, as ``pending``, and
        granted by the caller after this transaction commits — which is the
        only ordering that leaves no instant where somebody has accepted and
        nothing knows a grant is due. Empty means owes nothing, which is the
        default and what a deployment without membership authority passes.

        Takes the **digest**, never the raw secret. The caller hashes at the
        edge, so no frame in this service ever binds a live credential to a
        name; the digest is not one — it grants nothing and is already what
        the column stores. On the accept route the hashing call cannot raise
        (its argument is a pydantic-validated ASCII ``str``), so it does not
        appear in a traceback either; that is a property of the route's
        validation, not of the hash function being total over all inputs.

        The accepter authenticates at identity level — by definition they
        belong to no organization yet, so the membership choke point would
        refuse them before this code ran. Their authority here is not a role;
        it is holding the secret *and* controlling the invited mailbox, and
        both are checked below.

        Structure, and why it is two phases:

        1. **Pre-read, outside any transaction.** Every terminal state that
           does not require a mutation is answered here, so the common
           failures (expired link, wrong mailbox, replayed token) never open
           a transaction. This phase also decides the audit action and scope,
           which :func:`~.audit.audited` requires *before* the body runs and
           will not let the body rewrite.
        2. **The audited transaction.** Re-reads the row ``FOR UPDATE`` and
           re-runs every check against that locked row, which is the only
           authoritative evaluation. The pre-read's conclusions are advisory;
           nothing is decided by them that the locked read does not confirm.

        The scope declared up front cannot go stale, and that is a property
        of the schema rather than of timing: ``org_id`` is immutable for the
        row's whole life, so whether this acceptance creates an organization
        is fixed at issuance. That immutability is **enforced** — a trigger
        in migration v3 refuses any UPDATE that changes it, including one run
        by hand in psql — because this argument is load-bearing and a
        convention nobody can violate by accident is not the same as one
        nothing can violate. The only thing that can change between the two
        phases is ``status``, and every changed status raises.

        Concurrency, stated as the mechanisms rather than as a hope:

        - **Two accepts of one token.** They serialize on the ``FOR UPDATE``
          row lock. The loser re-reads the committed row, sees ``accepted``,
          and raises — so at most one membership, and for an org-creating
          invitation the loser's organization insert rolls back with it.
        - **One login accepting two different tokens.** They lock different
          rows and never meet, so the barrier is
          ``collab_org_members``'s primary key on ``user_id``: the second
          insert conflicts, and the whole transaction — organization insert
          included — rolls back. Exactly one membership and exactly one
          organization.
        - **Failure never consumes a token.** The invitation UPDATE is the
          last statement in the body, and any raise above it rolls back
          everything, audit row included.
        - **Stricter isolation levels.** Under REPEATABLE READ or
          SERIALIZABLE the same races abort with a serialization failure
          instead of resolving; :func:`_retrying` turns that back into the
          promised terminal state rather than a 503. See its docstring.

        **Why a row and not only a log line.** A log line is found only by
        somebody who already suspects; a row is found by a query. This is the
        *history* half of #180 — what was attempted and when — and it sits
        beside the state half in ``collab_service_access_grants``, which is what
        makes a failure reconcilable. Two records because they answer different
        questions and fail differently: this one is best-effort, and the state
        row is not.

        **Both outcomes, on purpose.** Recording only failures would make the
        table say nothing about the grants that worked, and the trail is read to
        answer "what happened to this person" as often as "what went wrong".
        Reconciliation does not read this row at all — that is
        :meth:`outstanding_service_access_grants`, over stored state — so
        losing this write loses a line of history rather than the fact that a
        grant is owed.

        **This is not the audited-mutation pattern, and says so.** Every other
        writer in this class runs its mutation *inside* the audited
        transaction, because the row and the change must land together. Here
        the change is an HTTP call to the identity provider that has already
        happened and cannot be rolled back, so the body writes nothing: the
        row records an outcome rather than guarding one. Using :func:`audited`
        anyway is deliberate — it is the only writer of this table, and a
        second insert path would be exactly the drift its "one writer" rule
        exists to prevent.

        ``target_type`` is ``user`` and ``target_id`` the accepter's ``sub``:
        the grant's target is the person, and the group is in ``detail``.

        **The accepter's address is on this row**, in ``actor_label``, because
        :func:`audited` snapshots ``ctx.display.email`` for every row it writes
        — the accepter is the actor here, and a row read months later showing
        only a UUID is the thing that column exists to prevent. Not suppressed
        for this action: it would make the grant row the one row in the table
        a person cannot read, and the table's contract already puts it in scope
        for any future deletion-request handling. What is kept off the row is a
        *second* copy — ``target_label`` is unset, and ``detail`` carries the
        invitation id rather than the address.
