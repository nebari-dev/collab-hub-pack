"""Reading ``collab_audit_events``.

The writer lives in :mod:`.audit` and stays the only writer. This module reads,
and does nothing else: there is no update, no delete, and no insert here, which
is what makes "append-only" a property of the code rather than a convention
somebody remembers.

Keyset paging, not offset
-------------------------
The log is append-only and read newest-first, so a page is "the next *n* rows
below this id". That is one index seek, it is stable while the log is being
written to -- an ``OFFSET`` page shifts under you every time a row lands above
it, silently repeating or skipping entries -- and it never has to count the
rows it is skipping over.

What the caller gets back is the id to ask below next, rather than a page
number, because a page number would be a lie the moment the log grew.
