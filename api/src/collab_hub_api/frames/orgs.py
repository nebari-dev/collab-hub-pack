"""Organization membership reads for the auth choke point.

Collab Server owns the organization model; the identity provider only
authenticates. The tables are created by the versioned runner in
:mod:`.collab_schema` (issue #62); this module is the read surface issue #63
needs — "which organization does this subject belong to, and in what role" —
and nothing more.

**Read-only, with one declared exception.** Organization and membership
*writes* (create an org, invite, accept, remove, transfer ownership) are
separate issues with their own policy decisions; adding speculative write
methods here would bake in guesses about them. The one write that does live
here is :meth:`OrgStore.provision_member` (issue #91): the single-organization
mode's auto-admission runs *inside* org resolution at the auth choke point —
the row has to exist before a context can be built from it — so its writer
belongs next to its readers. It is deliberately the narrowest write that
works: insert-if-absent, never update, never delete, never resurrect a
``removed`` row. Platform-role *writes* are likewise absent on purpose — the
bootstrap operator is a documented psql insert, and grant/revoke endpoints are
built the second time they are needed.

Backend semantics mirror ``usage.py``/``history.py``: a relational feature
riding the shared ``frames.postgres`` URL, with ``InMemory`` as a test/dev
override and an unavailable store when no database is configured. The
unavailable store **raises** rather than returning ``None`` — membership is an
authorization input, so "no backend" has to be indistinguishable from a denial
at the call site and can never degrade into "this user has no organization".
