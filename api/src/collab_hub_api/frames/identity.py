"""ACL identity policy: which claim becomes the persisted principal, and what may be granted.

Legacy behavior resolves the stored owner identity from
``("preferred_username", "email", "sub")`` in order. Both fallbacks are unsafe
on a deployment with password accounts: ``preferred_username`` is user-chosen
and Keycloak lets it change, and ``email`` is self-asserted. The resolved
string is *persisted* in the six sites issue #61 names — which expand to nine
columns/fields — none of which has a rename path:

1. ``FrameMetadata.created_by`` — ``frames/models.py``, written by
   ``FrameStore.create_frame`` (``frames/store.py``).
2. ``FrameMetadata.owners`` — same models/store, plus ``set_owners``.
3. ``FrameMetadata.readers`` — same models/store, plus ``set_readers``.
4. ``Suggestion.submitted_by`` — ``frames/models.py``, written by
   ``FrameStore.add_suggestion`` (``frames/store.py``).
5. ``FrameGroup.created_by`` and ``FrameGroup.owners`` — ``frames/groups.py``
   (``created_by``/``owners`` columns of ``frames_server_frame_groups``).
6. ``frames_server_history.actor`` — ``frames/history.py``.

plus two primary keys built from the same string:

7. ``frames_server_active_frames (org_id, workspace_id, user_id)`` —
   ``frames/active_state.py``.
8. ``frames_server_usage_users (org_id, workspace_id, user_id)`` —
   ``frames/usage.py``.

and one more the issue's inventory does not name, found while writing this list:

9. ``frames_server_usage_events.user_id`` — ``frames/usage.py``. Not an ACL, but
   the same string, so an identity migration (#65) has to carry it too or the
   usage history splits in two.

So a username change silently orphans every frame that user owns, and there is
no in-place fix short of a data migration (issue #65). Pinning the principal to
the immutable ``sub`` removes the failure mode — but *flipping* the precedence
on a deployment that already stores email/username principals orphans that data
just as permanently, which is why the pin is a per-deployment choice with the
old behavior as its default, not a code-wide change.

``FRAMES_AUTH_IDENTITY_CLAIM`` selects the policy:

- unset or ``legacy`` — the historical precedence tuple. What every existing
  deployment keeps on upgrade, including the internal hub until its Gate D
  migration window (issue #65).
- ``sub`` — the verified ``sub`` claim is the only accepted identity, and ACL
  principals written *through the API* are subjects. Email-shaped grants are
  **rejected, not silently stored** (version-skew flag S1): a stored email
  principal matches no caller, so it looks like a successful share while
  granting nothing. For the external Collab deployment, which starts with no
  data.

**Subjects are opaque.** Nothing here infers identity from the *syntax* of a
``sub``. Keycloak mints dashed-hex UUIDs for realm-local accounts, composite
``f:<provider-id>:<external-id>`` values for federated-storage accounts, and
whatever an operator configures for service accounts — all equally valid, and a
token carrying any of them authenticates and has its subject persisted as
``created_by``. Validating a UUID shape on the grant path would therefore refuse
to grant to users the same deployment happily creates frames for, and would
refuse the very values the user directory hands the member picker
(``user_directory.py`` returns Keycloak's raw ``id``). The authoritative check
is **membership, not syntax** — "is this principal a member of the caller's
organization" — and it arrives with the scoped member list in
nebari-dev/collab-hub-pack#99. Until then the only thing rejected is the
mistake S1 names: a value that is an email address.

**Single-issuer assumption (review register R12).** A bare ``sub`` is unique
only *within* one issuer, so this deployment assumes exactly one trusted
issuer, and principals are therefore not issuer-qualified. That assumption is
load-bearing, not stylistic: the IdToken and bearer verifiers are configured
independently (``FRAMES_IDTOKEN_*`` / ``FRAMES_BEARER_*``), so a deployment
trusting two issuers would let a colliding ``sub`` minted by the second issuer
*be* the first issuer's user — read and manage. It is therefore enforced at
startup by :func:`enforce_single_issuer_for_pin`, not merely recorded. Trusting
a second issuer requires moving to ``(iss, sub)`` principals **first**, which is
itself a data migration.

    The IdToken verifier is derived **exactly** as
    :func:`~.auth.decode_id_token_payload` derives it, because anything looser
    misses real configurations: that function falls back to the bearer JWKS URL
