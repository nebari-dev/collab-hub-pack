"""Provider-safe invitation email delivery.

This module deliberately stops at the delivery boundary. Invitation state,
token rotation, durable rate limiting, and audited mutation belong to the
invitation lifecycle service; the provider must not guess those semantics.

The successful SES result is named ``provider_accepted`` rather than
``delivered``. A successful ``SendEmail`` call only proves that SES accepted
the request. Later delivery, bounce, complaint, and delay events are separate
runtime evidence.

    This used to compose its own terse message. It no longer does, and that is

    operator pastes it from the invitation page or the server sends it, because
    both render ``web/onboarding_email.txt`` — the single copy approved on #153.

    Composing a second version here is what produced the divergence that issue
    was opened about. The old message told the reader replies would not be read,
    while the manual flow depended on them writing in; it carried no data
    statement (#146); and it said nothing about what happens between
    registering and accepting, which is the one thing an invitee most needs
    told. That gap was filled first by a step explaining that no verification
    mail was coming, and then -- once the realm gained SMTP and
    `verifyEmail=true` -- by the instruction to open the verification email and
    reopen the invitation link.

    **Layering, stated rather than hidden.** The template lives under ``web/``
    because the invitation pages render it too, so this imports "upwards". The
    alternative was a second copy of the words on this side, which is precisely
    the failure above. Importing it costs nothing but strings —
    :mod:`..web.data_statement` defers its page import for exactly this reason —
    so no browser-surface machinery reaches the mail path.

    ``organization_name`` is accepted and deliberately unused: the approved copy
    is org-neutral, because operator invitations may *create* an organization
    where owner invitations join one, and one text serves both. It stays in the
    signature because the delivery contract is #89's and should not churn for a
    copy decision — and if the copy ever names the organization, this is where
    it plugs in.
