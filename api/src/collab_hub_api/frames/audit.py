"""The transaction-bound audited-execution primitive (issue #87, Gate E).

Every privileged action reaches the system through an interface that
authorizes *and* records it. This module is the **recording** half, and only
that: one context manager, :func:`audited`, that runs an already-authorized
mutation and its ``collab_audit_events`` row **in the same database
transaction**, committing or rolling back both together. Authorization policy
is the other half and lives in :mod:`.authorization` — the two are separate
concerns and must not be fused (an org owner and a platform operator both
perform some of the same recorded actions, so a single ``@operator_action``
decorator would either lock owners out or make its own check meaningless).

Why a context manager and not a decorator: the guarantee is the shared
transaction, not the syntax. The caller's mutation must run on **the same
connection** that writes the event row, so the primitive owns the connection
checkout and hands the body a :class:`GuardedConnection` — a handle that can
execute statements inside the transaction but **cannot complete it**. Three
layers stand between the body and a detached mutation:

1. **The Python surface is closed.** ``commit``/``rollback``/``close``/
   ``set_autocommit`` (or assignment to ``autocommit``) raise
   :class:`AuditTransactionViolation`; cursors come back wrapped so their
   ``.connection`` back-reference cannot hand out the raw connection; the
   body runs inside an explicit ``conn.transaction()`` block that only
   :func:`audited` itself can complete, so even the raw psycopg connection
   refuses a Python-level ``commit()``.
2. **Transaction-control SQL is screened.** psycopg only intercepts the
   *method* calls — ``execute("COMMIT")`` goes to the server as text — so
   the guard screens every statement (string literals, dollar-quoted
   bodies, identifiers, and comments blanked first, under **both** of
   PostgreSQL's quoting regimes; multi-statement strings split) and refuses
   statement-leading ``COMMIT``/``ROLLBACK`` (except ``ROLLBACK TO`` a
   savepoint)/``BEGIN``/``START``/``END``/``ABORT``/``PREPARE
   TRANSACTION``. A ``psycopg.sql`` composable is rendered to bytes once,
   screened, and *those same bytes* are what execute, so the screened text
   is exactly what the server receives. Residual imperfection, stated
   honestly: SQL hidden inside a ``DO`` body is blanked as a dollar-quoted
   literal, and a ``CALL``ed procedure's body is never seen at all — but
   PostgreSQL refuses transaction termination inside either when it runs in
   an explicit transaction block (``invalid transaction termination``),
   which this always is; a live test pins that.
3. **A backstop converts any unforeseen escape into a loud failure.**
   Immediately before the event insert, :func:`audited` asserts the
   connection is still inside the explicit transaction
   (``conn.info.transaction_status == INTRANS``); anything else raises
   :class:`AuditTransactionBrokenError`. It cannot un-commit a mutation,
   but it turns silent audit divergence into a named 500.

::

    with audited(db, ctx, "invitation.send", target_type="org", target_id=org_id) as ev:
        invitation = create_invitation(ev.conn, ...)   # same conn/transaction
        ev.detail = {"email_domain": domain_of(email)}  # redacted

On clean exit the event row is inserted on that connection and both writes
commit together; an exception anywhere — in the mutation, in the event
insert — rolls back both. A mutation without its event row, or an event row
without its mutation, is therefore impossible *for mutations that live in
this transaction*.

**The residual boundary, stated plainly.** Nothing here can extend the
guarantee to work the body does outside this transaction: a second, separate
``db.connection()`` checkout commits independently (do not open one inside a
body — there is no mechanical guard against it, only this contract and
review), and non-Postgres side effects (sending the SES email, writing S3)
are inherently outside any database transaction. Consumers (#89) must
sequence unrecoverable side effects **after** ``audited()`` returns, so a
rollback never has to un-send an email.

What must never appear in a row: secrets. ``detail`` is redacted by its
writer and must NEVER hold an invitation token or anything derived from one.
``actor``/``target_id`` are subs and opaque ids; the ``*_label`` fields exist
precisely so human-readable snapshots have a place that is *not* the
principal columns. All row fields are bounded and validated before the
insert — see :data:`AUDIT_LABEL_MAX_CHARS`, :data:`AUDIT_ID_MAX_CHARS`, and
:data:`AUDIT_DETAIL_MAX_BYTES`.

**Append-only is a convention, not an enforced boundary.** The application
role owns ``collab_audit_events`` (auto-migration creates it over the runtime
pool), so a ``REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE`` would prove today's ACL and nothing
more — a Postgres owner can re-grant to itself. The honest, testable claim is
that no application code path updates or deletes rows of this table; this
module is the only writer, it only INSERTs, and a test asserts the absence of
any other DML against the table across the source tree.

# --- Transaction-control SQL screening -------------------------------------
#
# psycopg's explicit transaction block intercepts the Python commit()/
# rollback() methods, not SQL text: execute("COMMIT") goes to the server and
# commits. The guard therefore screens every statement the body executes.
# Screening is textual, so it first blanks out everything that can *contain*
# the keywords without *being* them — string literals, dollar-quoted bodies,
# double-quoted identifiers, and both comment forms — then splits on ';' and
# inspects each statement's leading keywords. Only statement-leading keywords
# matter: PostgreSQL has no way to embed transaction control mid-statement. A
# DO block's body is a dollar-quoted literal and is blanked, and a CALLed
# procedure's body is not in the text at all — but PostgreSQL refuses
# transaction termination inside either when it runs in an explicit
# transaction block, which audited() always is.
#
# The blanking is a hand-written single-pass scanner rather than a union of
# regexes, because every hole found in this screen has been a *lexing*
# disagreement with the server, and only a scanner can follow the server's
# actual rules:
#
# - Block comments nest. `/* /* */ ' */ COMMIT` is one comment followed by a
#   real COMMIT. A non-greedy regex ends the comment at the first `*/`, and
#   re-running it to a fixpoint (the shape this code used to have) then reads
#   the leftover quote as a literal that swallows the COMMIT. The scanner
#   counts depth, as PostgreSQL's lexer does.
# - A prefix only introduces a token where it does not *continue an
#   identifier*, because identifiers admit letters, digits, `_` and `$` and
#   the lexer takes the longest match (PostgreSQL's lexical structure rules).
#   Two constructs here have such a prefix, and both were holes:
#     * `E'...'`. The server lexes `name'abc\'` as the identifier `name`
#       followed by an ordinary literal — a valid `name`-typed constant — so
#       treating every `[eE]'` as an E-string reads
#       `SELECT name'abc\'; COMMIT; SELECT name'x'` as one long literal and
#       lets the COMMIT through.
#     * `$tag$...$tag$`. `x$tag$` is simply the identifier `x$tag$`, so
#       `SELECT 1 AS x$tag$; COMMIT; SELECT $tag$foo$tag$;` is an aliased
#       select, a statement end, and a COMMIT — while a scanner that opens a
#       dollar quote at the first `$tag$` blanks the COMMIT away inside a
#       phantom body.
#   Both are verified live. The other quoted-literal prefixes need no such
#   rule: `U&'...'`, `B'...'` and `X'...'` never give backslash a meaning, so
#   reading them as plain literals is the server's own reading whether or not
#   the prefix was absorbed by an identifier, and `N'...'` is not a PostgreSQL
#   construct at all (it lexes as identifier plus literal, like `name'...'`).
# - Unterminated literals, comments and dollar quotes run to the end of the
#   text, exactly as the server's lexer treats them. Such a string is a
#   syntax error, and PostgreSQL parses the *whole* simple-query string
#   before executing any part of it, so nothing in it can run.
#
# Plain-literal semantics are the remaining trap, so the text is scanned
# under BOTH of PostgreSQL's quoting regimes and refused if EITHER exposes
# transaction control:
#
# - standard_conforming_strings = on (the server default): backslash is a
#   plain character in a '...' literal, which ends only via '' doubling.
#   A scanner that honored \' here would swallow real statements into a
#   phantom literal: `SELECT '\'; COMMIT; SELECT 'x'` ends its first literal
#   at the second quote and the server executes the COMMIT.
# - standard_conforming_strings = off (legacy): \' continues a '...'
#   literal, so the mirrored payload `SELECT '\', 'x; COMMIT; --'` is the
#   dangerous one there.
#
# `E'...'` honors backslash escapes under both regimes, and the two regimes
# can disagree only where a backslash occurs, so the legacy scan is skipped
# for text without one. Dual scanning is also what makes the GUC irrelevant:
# it may be off in the server's own configuration or the connection string,
# and a body may flip it mid-session (`SET standard_conforming_strings = off`
# screens clean — it is not transaction control, and refusing it would buy
# nothing against the other two routes) — but every statement is screened
# under both readings regardless, so no reading of the GUC helps an attacker.
# The cost is conservatism: text that is only a literal under one regime is
# refused if the other regime reads transaction control out of it. Refusing
# legal-but-ambiguous SQL is the right direction for an audit guard.
#
# Exactness versus over-refusal — a recorded decision, not a default. Every
# hole found here chose exactness at a lexer decision point, so refusing any
# statement whose text contains the exotic constructs at all (dollar quotes,
# E-strings, nested block comments) would retire that surface as a class.
# The exact lexer is kept deliberately: (1) plain literals, line comments and
# statement splitting must be lexed faithfully regardless — bodies genuinely
# contain them — so the scanner's irreducible core stays either way; (2) DO
# bodies are dollar-quoted, legitimate inside audited() (PostgreSQL refuses
# transaction termination within them in an explicit block, proven live),
# and psycopg composables render to arbitrary quoted text, so over-refusal
# has real casualties; and (3) the differential fuzz
# (test_audit_screen_differential_fuzz.py) now stands behind the exact lexer
# as a live CI gate, which is what the over-refusal argument was buying.
# Revisit toward over-refusal if audited() bodies remain hand-written
# INSERT/UPDATE only and the fuzz ever finds a round 6.


# The character classes below are PostgreSQL's (src/backend/parser/scan.l),
# not Python's. The server lexes *bytes* and admits every high-bit byte as an
# identifier character, so on a str the faithful translation is "any code
# point outside ASCII" — whatever Python thinks of it. `str.isalnum()` is
# False for a combining mark, a ZWJ, an emoji and NBSP, every one of which
# continues an identifier for the server: reading `SELECT 1 AS á$tag$;
# COMMIT; ...` (an `a` and a combining acute) as an opening dollar-quote
# rather than an identifier hides a statement-leading COMMIT, verified live.
# Working in code points is exact for what the lexer actually sees, because
# PostgreSQL converts the client encoding to the server encoding before
# parsing and a server encoding must be ASCII-safe — so a non-ASCII character
# is always exactly a run of high-bit bytes, never one with an ASCII byte in
# it.
