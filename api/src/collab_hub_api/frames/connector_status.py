"""What an operator can truthfully be told about each connector.

Read-only, and deliberately so. Turning a connector on or off from the panel
would mean the panel writing deployment configuration, which is a much larger
change than it appears -- the values are Helm's, a running pod would have to be
told, and two sources of truth for "is Slack on" is precisely the kind of
divergence an admin panel is supposed to remove.

Why there is no green tick
--------------------------
Most connectors here are **brokered**: the access token is minted per user at
request time, so the hub holds no credential of its own for them. "Is Slack
healthy" therefore has no hub-level answer -- it has one answer per person, and
the server cannot produce any of them without acting as that person.

A connector configured with a **static** token is different: the hub does hold
a credential, and a probe would say something real. This module reports which
case each connector is in, and nothing more. Reporting a health state derived
from the presence of a configuration value would be a claim dressed as a
measurement, which on an administration screen is worse than saying nothing.

Nothing here reads a secret's value. ``configured`` is derived from whether a
credential source is *set*, never from what it contains, and the dataclass
carries no field that could hold one.
