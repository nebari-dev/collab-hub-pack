"""Adding accounts to service groups in Keycloak (issue #180).

The one implementation of :class:`~.account_provisioning.ServiceAccessGranter`
that can actually write. Everything about its authority is deliberately narrow,
and the narrowness was measured rather than assumed (#172):

* it holds ``Groups/manage-membership`` on the granted groups and
  ``Users/manage-group-membership``. Both are required -- the group-side scope
  alone refuses every call, including the one it is named for;
* it does **not** hold ``Groups/manage-members``. That scope, over a member of
  the group, also permits password reset, email change and deletion. A
  credential that could grant inference access *and* rewrite the password of
  everyone who has it would be a much larger thing than this needs to be;
* the same credential may hold ``manage-members`` on a **different** group --
  the account-creation staging group -- because the two only compose into
  takeover on the *same* group. That rule is why this is a separate protocol
  from the account provisioner rather than another method on it.

Where the group id comes from
-----------------------------
Keycloak's membership endpoint needs a group **id**, and configuration names
groups the way a person reads them (``/llm``), so something has to bridge the
two. There are two ways, and which one a deployment uses decides how much
authority this credential needs.

**Configured ids (preferred).** ``group_ids`` maps each path to its id, and
nothing is looked up. This is what collab-hub does, and the reason is not
convenience: resolving a path requires *reading* groups, and this credential
deliberately cannot read anything. Its measured boundary is writes to the
granted groups and 403 on every read -- including ``GET /groups`` -- so a
deployment that made startup depend on that lookup would have to widen the
credential to permit it. Configured ids keep the credential exactly as narrow
as it was proven to be, and remove any startup call to the identity provider
at all, so a Keycloak blip during a rollout cannot stop the API from starting.

**Looking the path up (fallback).** For a deployment whose credential *does*
hold group-read authority, an unmapped path is resolved once at startup and
cached. A configured group that does not exist then refuses to start, which
follows the house rule applied to ``appInstructions`` and
``web.public_base_url``: a deployment that cannot do what its configuration
says should fail where somebody is watching.

The cost of configured ids is honest and small: a values file carries a UUID,
and an id that goes stale -- which takes deleting and recreating the group,
a deliberate act rather than drift -- fails at grant time instead of at
startup. That failure is not silent, because #180 records it as a durable
``failed`` row a reconciler finds.
