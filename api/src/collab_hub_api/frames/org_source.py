"""Where the auth choke point gets the caller's organization: claims, membership, or single.

``auth_context_from_claims`` historically read ``org_id``/``workspace_id`` from
the token, with ``FRAMES_AUTH_DEFAULT_ORG``/``FRAMES_AUTH_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE``
as fallbacks. On a deployment where Keycloak mints no org claim — which is
every deployment today — that fallback is what every caller actually gets, so
**every user collapses into one organization and ``internal`` means "everyone
on the server"**. Retiring it is issue #63.

``FRAMES_AUTH_ORG_SOURCE`` selects the source:

- ``claims`` (or unset) — the historical behavior, unchanged byte for byte.
  What every existing deployment keeps on upgrade.
- ``membership`` — the server owns the org model: the caller's one
  ``collab_org_members`` row decides ``(org_id, role)``, ``workspace_id`` is
  the constant ``"default"``, org claims in the token are ignored entirely, and
  the ``FRAMES_AUTH_DEFAULT_*`` fallbacks are refused rather than ignored.
- ``single`` (issue #91) — membership resolution plus one declared difference:
  the deployment states that it hosts exactly one organization, and a caller
  with **no membership row at all** whose sign-in arrived through a *declared
  identity source* is auto-admitted — a real ``collab_org_members`` row is
  written on their first authenticated request. Everything else is byte for
  byte membership mode: rows stay the single source of truth, existing rows
  (active or removed, any organization) are authoritative and never rewritten,
  and every membership-mode precondition still applies. This is the mode's
  entire delta; it replaces the retired defaults, it does not revive them.

**Why auto-admission is gated on a declared identity source, not on
authentication.** "Every authenticated user is a member" admits every door
into the realm equally: federated sign-in (constrained by the provider's
domain policy), self-registration (constrained by ``registrationAllowed``),
and accounts an administrator created by hand — constrained by nothing, and
the mechanism by which one-off test accounts exist. Gating on the token's
``identity_provider`` claim makes the boundary the *declared provider's*
membership policy: a caller federated from a listed provider is admitted, and
any other login authenticates fine but resolves to ``no_organization`` until
membership is granted deliberately. The declaration is also checkable — the
alias either exists on the realm or it does not — where "anyone who can
authenticate" silently widens every time an account is created.

**Why this is a separate switch from the identity pin.** It would have been
shorter to hang membership resolution off ``FRAMES_AUTH_IDENTITY_CLAIM=sub``
(issue #61), since membership rows are keyed by the subject and the pin is
therefore a hard precondition of this mode. It is deliberately not done that
way: the internal hub's migration has to pin identity *first*, backfill
membership rows against the resulting subjects, verify coverage, and only then
retire the fallback. Fused into one switch, that sequence has no middle state
to stop in — the flip would strand every user whose membership row had not
been written yet. Two switches, one of which is a precondition of the other,
keeps the two steps independently reversible.

The parsing contract mirrors ``frames.identity``: exact match, no trimming or
case folding, and an unrecognized value fails startup instead of guessing.
Guessing is wrong in every direction here — quietly choosing ``claims`` would
resurrect the default-org fallback on the external deployment, quietly
choosing ``membership`` would lock out every user of a hub that has no
membership rows, and quietly choosing ``single`` would start admitting realm
accounts to an organization nobody declared.
