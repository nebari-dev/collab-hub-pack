"""The account-provisioning claim and its phases (issue #172).

Setting an invitee's account up spans four systems that cannot commit
together: this database, Keycloak's user store, Keycloak's mail, and the
invitation email. So the workflow is written down as it goes, and every
interruption resumes from what was written rather than from what a caller
remembers.

Why a table, and why keyed this way
-----------------------------------
This row is two things at once, and the second is the reason it is a table
rather than a column on ``collab_invitations``.

**It is the durable phase**, so an interrupted run is resumable: an ambiguous
``POST /users`` is settled by reading, not by retrying blind.

**It is the claim that serializes provisioning.** The primary key is the
folded address, so the first writer wins and a second concurrent request's
insert conflicts — it learns it is not the creator and reads this row instead
of creating a second account. ``pg_advisory_xact_lock`` cannot do that job
here: the invitation row commits *before* the external calls, deliberately,
because an audited claim without an account is the recoverable partial state
and the reverse is not — and a transaction-scoped lock is gone at commit. The
window this row closes is exactly the window that lock leaves open.

**Keyed per address, not per invitation.** Two live invitations for one
address are deliberate on the ``/v1`` routes and pinned by a regression test.
Provisioning happens at most once per address; issuance may repeat. Keyed per
invitation, two invitations would own one account.

**Keyed on the folded address** (:func:`~.invitations.ascii_folded_bytes`, the
form Gate B matches since #157). Storing the raw address would let ``Alice@``
and ``alice@`` each provision an account when only one of them can ever accept.

What this module deliberately does not do
-----------------------------------------
It talks to no identity provider. It records phases and hands out claims; the
Keycloak calls live behind ``InvitationAccountProvisioner``, so this module
stays testable against a database alone and the authority to write accounts
sits in one named place rather than diffused through the workflow.

        **The guard is in the write, not in front of it.** An earlier version of
        this method read the phase, compared positions in Python, and then wrote
        without a predicate -- which loses the race it exists to referee. Two
        advancers interleave, the one holding the older snapshot commits last,
        and a record that reached ``complete`` is stamped back to
        ``setup_sent``. That is designed traffic rather than abuse: this module
        invites concurrent advancers (any caller may push a stalled record
        along, with no lease and no liveness protocol) and re-asserting the
        current phase is the documented way to resume.

        A rewind is the worst possible failure for this table, because
        ``may_be_written_to`` is read from the phase: it would report an account
        as writable after cleanup had already removed it from the staging group,
        and the resulting refusal is exactly the puzzling 403 the guard exists
        to prevent.

        So the ordering lives in the ``WHERE`` clause, evaluated against the row
        as it is at write time. There is no read to be stale, and the phase
        order is still :data:`PHASES` -- passed as a parameter rather than
        spelled again in SQL.

        Re-asserting the current phase remains a no-op on the phase, so a
        resumed send need not special-case itself. ``idp_user_id`` is
        **first-write-wins**: recovery reads that column to decide adopt or

        silently replacing the evidence.
