"""Reading and changing Keycloak group membership, for the admin panel.

The one place in this codebase that writes to Keycloak. Everywhere else it is
a plain OIDC provider: the platform-role sync reads a claim and writes only to
this database, and the user directory reads.

How this differs from the invitation-time granter
-------------------------------------------------
:class:`~.keycloak_service_access.KeycloakServiceAccessGranter` exists to add a
newly-provisioned account to a service group, and was deliberately built unable
to do anything else -- it cannot read, so it cannot even resolve a group path,
and its group ids are configured for that reason.

The panel needs two things that granter cannot do: list who is in a group, and
take somebody out. Both need scopes it does not hold, so this is a separate
client with a separate credential rather than a widening of that one. Keeping
them apart means the invitation path's authority does not grow because an admin
screen needed something.

The scope boundary, which is the point
--------------------------------------
This credential needs ``Groups/view-members`` to list, and
``Groups/manage-membership`` plus ``Users/manage-group-membership`` to add and
remove.

It must **not** hold ``Groups/manage-members``. Over a member of a group that
scope also permits password reset, email change and deletion -- so a credential
that could both put somebody into the model group and rewrite their password
could take over any account it chose. The two halves are safe apart and are
account takeover together.

That rule is enforced here by construction rather than by trusting the realm:
the only requests this class can issue are a member listing and a membership
``PUT``/``DELETE``, there is no method that touches an account, and the group
ids it will act on are a configured set. A test pins the public surface, so
adding a method that could create or delete an account fails at unit speed.

Group ids are configured, not looked up, for the reason the granter documents:
resolving a path requires reading the group tree, and a deployment should not
have to widen a credential so that startup can ask a question the values file
already answers.
