"""Machine-readable error codes carried by the frames API error envelope.

Every non-2xx response shaped by :func:`routers.frames.error_response` carries
``{"error": {"code": ..., "message": ...}}``. Clients branch on ``code`` and
never on ``message`` — the desktop's ``frontend/src/api/hubaccess.ts`` names
this module by path — so these strings are **wire contract**: never rename one,
and register a new one here before returning it so the spelling is decided once
and reused everywhere.

Scope: the codes emitted by the app-level handlers in :func:`core.make_app`,
the path-protection middleware, and the auth choke point. Router-local codes
(``frame_not_found``, ``groups_unavailable``, …) are still spelled at their
handlers in ``routers/``; moving them here is a mechanical follow-up, not part
of this module's contract.
