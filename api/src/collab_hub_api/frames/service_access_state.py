"""The durable record of what an acceptance owes somebody (issue #180).

The audit table records what happened; this table records **what is still
owed**. They are different jobs and the difference is load-bearing here.

An invitation's acceptance commits, and only then is the accepter added to the
configured identity-provider groups — deliberately, because a group write
cannot be rolled back and an outage must not cost somebody a membership they
hold a valid invitation and a verified address for. That ordering leaves a
window, and the first version of this feature left the window open: a fault
between the group call and the audit insert lost the fact that anything had
been attempted at all, so nothing could find the invitee who ended up with no
service access.

**What closes it is writing the intent first, inside the acceptance's own
transaction.** The acceptance already requires this database — if it were
unreachable there would be no acceptance to reconcile — so the intent row
costs no new failure mode, and being in that transaction means it lands if and
only if the acceptance does. Afterwards the row is *settled* to its outcome.
Every way the process can die now resolves to the same safe state:

===============================  ===========================================
Where it stops                   What the row says, and what happens next
===============================  ===========================================
before the group call            ``pending`` -> retried, and the add is
                                 idempotent
after the call, before settling  ``pending`` -> retried, idempotent again
settling fails                   ``pending`` -> same
the call itself fails            ``failed`` -> retried
nothing fails                    ``granted`` -> nothing to do
===============================  ===========================================

So "outstanding" is a single row's state rather than an inference over ordered
audit rows — which also removes the question of whether a ``bigserial``
reflects commit order (it does not; it is allocated at ``INSERT``).

**One row per person and group, forever.** The primary key is
``(user_id, group_path)`` because that pair *is* the grant: a second
invitation to the same person does not create a second thing to do. The
invitation recorded is the first one that wanted it, kept for context.
