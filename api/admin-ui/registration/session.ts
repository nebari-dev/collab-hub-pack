/**
 * What the hub knows about this browser, asked before the page shows a state.
 *
 * The hub knows three things this code cannot work out: whether the browser
 * holds a session, whether that session's verified email address was asserted
 * recently enough to accept an invitation on, and the CSRF token an acceptance
 * must carry. The token lives inside the HttpOnly session cookie, which this
 * code cannot read by design, so the hub hands it over here.
 *
 * The URL is relative to the document at `/invite/accept`: the hub can be
 * served under a root-path prefix, and an absolute path would miss it.
